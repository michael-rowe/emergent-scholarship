# Why does it matter?

Emergent scholarship matters because our most pressing challenges—from climate change to healthcare transformation to the societal impact of AI—require approaches to knowledge creation that are as complex, adaptive, and interconnected as the problems themselves. By reimagining scholarship as an emergent process that embraces complexity, fosters public engagement, and transcends traditional boundaries, we can:

- Create more responsive and relevant knowledge that addresses real-world problems
- Build adaptive capacity to respond to rapidly changing contexts
- Foster inclusive participation from diverse voices and perspectives
- Bridge the gap between academic knowledge and broader societal discourse
- Develop more sustainable practices that support both human wellbeing and environmental health

Emergent scholarship offers a pathway for anyone interested in navigating complexity, collaborating effectively, and continuing learning throughout their careers; for people who are equipped for the societal challenges of today and tomorrow.

Rather than treating this as a radical departure from traditional scholarship, we might better understand it as a necessary adaptation to the reality of our complex, interconnected world.

## What problems does it address?

Emergent Scholarship responds to several challenges in contemporary knowledge production:

- Traditional scholarship often struggles with complex, interconnected problems that cross disciplinary boundaries
- The current academic system can create perverse incentives that prioritize publication metrics over meaningful impact
- Knowledge creation is increasingly disconnected from broader social discourse, with academics primarily talking to each other
- Conventional research processes can be rigid and slow to adapt to urgent societal challenges
- Many voices and perspectives remain marginalized in traditional scholarly practices
- The exponential growth of information makes it impossible for any individual to comprehensively master a field

Emergent Scholarship aims to address the widening gap between how we teach within the formal education system, and what people actually need to thrive in society, which is increasingly characterised by unprecedented complexity, exponential knowledge growth, technological transformation, and system pressures.
