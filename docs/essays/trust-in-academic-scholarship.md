I guess a core part of this whole thing is where we situate our trust. As an academic community we've outsourced trust to the journals and publishers, assuming that they'll make sure that what we're reading and basing our scholarship on, is trustworthy. I need a model that both replicates the traditional system of trust through open peer review, doi, versioning, etc. but enhances it as well.

This is a deep and insightful observation about academic trust systems. The user has identified a fundamental aspect of academic publishing - the outsourcing of trust to publishers and journals as gatekeepers and validators of knowledge. Their new approach to scholarship is challenging this model while still needing to maintain some elements of trust and validation.

Let me explore how their approach to emergent scholarship shifts trust mechanisms:

Traditional academic trust is based on:

1. Pre-publication peer review (gatekeeping)
2. Journal reputation/prestige
3. Institutional backing
4. Citation metrics
5. Stability/permanence of published works
6. Publisher infrastructure for preservation

Their emergent scholarship model seems to be moving toward:

1. Open, ongoing peer review (development rather than gatekeeping)
2. Direct community engagement
3. Transparency of process
4. Versioning to show evolution of ideas
5. Multiple representations for different contexts
6. Self-managed infrastructure

The challenge is creating trustworthiness without traditional gatekeepers while not completely abandoning the established system that academics recognize. This is a socio-technical problem that requires both technical solutions (DOIs, versioning, metadata) and social ones (community norms, open review processes).

I should address:

1. How technical infrastructure can support trust (beyond just DOIs and versioning)
2. How social processes can build trust in this new model
3. How to balance innovation with connection to existing academic trust networks
4. How this approach potentially enhances trust through transparency and openness

You've touched on something profound that goes beyond technical implementation. Academic publishing isn't just a distribution system—it's a trust infrastructure that the community has outsourced to publishers and journals.

Your emergent scholarship model is essentially rebuilding that trust infrastructure in a more open, transparent way. Here's how I see this trust model evolving:

### Trust Through Transparency

Traditional publishing creates trust through gatekeeping and opacity (hidden reviews, closed editorial decisions). Your model creates trust through radical transparency:

1. **Visible evolution**: Readers can trace how ideas developed through Git commit history
2. **Open peer review**: GitHub Issues make reviewer comments and author responses public
3. **Process documentation**: The methodology is exposed rather than hidden

### Trust Through Connection

1. **Identity verification**: GitHub accounts provide persistent identities
2. **Community accountability**: Public conversations create community oversight
3. **Networked validation**: Links between your living documents, preprints, and journal versions create a web of validation

### Technical Enhancements to Build Trust

1. **Digital signatures**: Consider implementing GPG signing of commits and releases to verify authorship
2. **Provenance tracking**: Use tools like Merkle DAGs (what Git uses) to make tampering evident
3. **Multiple persistence strategies**: Beyond Zenodo, consider web archiving services like the Internet Archive and CLOCKSS

Your hybrid approach is particularly powerful because it doesn't abandon traditional trust signals but supplements them with new ones. The journal publication serves as a bridge to conventional academic trust, while your open process demonstrates a more evolved trust model.

This may actually be your most significant contribution—not just new content, but a new trust infrastructure for scholarship that enhances rather than replaces traditional models.

Let's say I want to write up this last part of our conversation, about trust. This is the core of my dilemma. Where do I publish it? On my existing blog, as a way of externalising my thought process related to the project? On the netlify deployed site as a part of the actual project (like a project diary)? On the github repo as a project note?

This is an interesting question about where to publish reflections on the trust infrastructure in scholarly publishing, especially given the multiple platforms available.

Let me analyze the options based on what I understand about the user's project and goals:

1. **Existing Blog**:
    - Pros: Has an established audience, history of thought leadership, connects to 15 years of context
    - Cons: Doesn't model the new approach, lacks the technical infrastructure being advocated for (GitHub issues for feedback, versioning)
    - Purpose: More of a personal narrative/thought diary
2. **Netlify Deployed Site (New Platform)**:
    - Pros: Actively demonstrates the model being advocated for, creates coherence with the project itself
    - Cons: Might not be seen by existing audience yet, more formal context perhaps
    - Purpose: The "living" public-facing implementation of the project
3. **GitHub Repo as Project Note**:
    - Pros: Most technically integrated with the development process
    - Cons: Less accessible to non-technical audience, typically less polished presentation
    - Purpose: Development documentation, technical notes

Given the user's overall project of reimagining scholarly communication and the principles of emergent scholarship they shared, my sense is that this content about trust infrastructure is actually central to the conceptual framework, not just a side note about process.

The dilemma seems to mirror the very content being discussed - where we place our trust in publishing systems, and how we validate knowledge.

Given that this is core to the project's intellectual foundation, and considering the principles of "Innovation through openness" and "Meaning through medium" from their document, I think there's a strong case for publishing this on the new platform (Netlify site) as it both demonstrates and explains the model simultaneously.

However, there might be a hybrid approach that would be even better, given that the user is trying to bridge traditional and new forms of scholarly communication.

Given that this discussion about trust infrastructure is central to your entire project (not peripheral), I recommend publishing it on your Netlify deployed site as a foundational piece of the project itself. This would:

1. Demonstrate your principles in action – the medium becomes part of the message
2. Establish core conceptual groundwork for visitors to understand your project
3. Create an opportunity to implement your versioning and DOI approach from the start

However, I'd suggest a deliberate cross-platform approach:

1. **Primary home**: The full essay on your Netlify site with proper versioning, DOI, and GitHub-based feedback mechanisms
    
2. **Blog signpost**: A shorter post on your existing blog that introduces the concept and links to the full piece, helping transition your existing audience
    
3. **GitHub documentation**: The technical implementation details in your GitHub README or documentation, focused on how others could adopt similar trust infrastructure
    

This layered approach mirrors the trust infrastructure you're building - different manifestations of the same core ideas for different contexts and audiences. It also models how your content can exist in multiple forms while maintaining conceptual coherence.

By publishing this reflection as a substantive piece on your new platform, you're not just writing about a new model of scholarly trust - you're actively implementing and demonstrating it.
