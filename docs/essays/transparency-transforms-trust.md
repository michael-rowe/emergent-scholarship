## Introduction

For centuries, we have outsourced trust to publishers and journals, assuming they would ensure that what we read and build upon is trustworthy. This system has created a robust but often inflexible infrastructure that privileges gatekeeping over dialogue and finished products over evolving ideas. But instead of rejecting this system entirely, we have an opportunity to reimagine trust in scholarship—to build bridges between traditional mechanisms that have served us well and emergent approaches that embrace connection, openness, and engagement.

This essay explores how we might create a trust infrastructure that both replicates valuable elements of traditional academic publishing and enhances them through principles of emergent scholarship. By examining the historical context of academic trust, identifying what remains valuable, and proposing practical implementations that bridge old and new, I hope to offer a path forward that doesn't demand revolution but instead invites evolution.

## The outsourcing of trust in academic scholarship

The outsourcing of trust to journals and publishers emerged from practical necessity. In pre-digital academia, the challenges of disseminating knowledge were immense: manuscripts had to be physically reproduced, shipped to libraries and individuals, and somehow made discoverable amid growing volumes of scholarly output. Individual scholars lacked the resources to solve these logistical challenges alone.

Publishers emerged as essential intermediaries who could manage reproduction, distribution, and preservation of scholarly work. Journals, with their editorial boards and review processes, developed as trust mechanisms that helped scholars filter an expanding universe of knowledge. By the mid-20th century, this system had crystallised into a formal structure with clear roles:

- Publishers managed the physical infrastructure of scholarly communication
- Editors served as disciplinary gatekeepers and curators
- Peer reviewers provided quality control through pre-publication assessment
- Academic institutions validated scholars through affiliation
- Citation metrics offered quantitative measures of influence

This system effectively solved problems of its time. Physical journals created permanent, unchangeable records. Editorial selection helped scholars navigate information overload. Peer review, though imperfect, provided quality assurance. Citation tracking created networks of related knowledge.

Yet these solutions also introduced constraints that persist even as technology has transformed what's possible. The closed, opaque nature of traditional peer review obscures the developmental dialogue that shapes ideas. The emphasis on finished products neglects the evolving nature of knowledge. The privileging of established voices can marginalise new perspectives. And perhaps most critically, the outsourcing of trust to commercial entities has created misaligned incentives between publishing profit and scholarly progress.

## Valuable elements worth preserving

Despite these limitations, traditional scholarship has developed several trust mechanisms that remain valuable and worth preserving. These elements address fundamental needs that persist regardless of technological context:

**Persistent identification** ensures that scholarly works remain findable and citable over time. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) have become the standard method for creating permanent references to published work, allowing citations to remain stable even as platforms change. This persistence is essential for building knowledge that extends beyond individual scholars or momentary technological conditions.

**Version control** provides clarity about which iteration of work is being discussed, cited, or built upon. In traditional publishing, this was accomplished through formal publication of discrete versions (e.g., preprint, published article, subsequent editions). The stability of these versions creates a shared reference point for scholarly conversation.

**Peer feedback** remains essential to knowledge development. While traditional blind peer review has limitations, the principle of knowledge refinement through expert assessment and dialogue continues to serve an important function. When scholars engage critically with each other's work, both the specific scholarship and the broader field benefit.

**Contextual placement** situates work within broader scholarly conversations, ensuring that new contributions acknowledge and build upon existing knowledge. Traditional mechanisms like literature reviews, citations, and disciplinary journals help establish this context, preventing fragmentation and repetition.

These elements constitute a trust infrastructure that has enabled remarkable scholarly progress. Yet they need not be implemented solely through traditional publishing models. Indeed, emerging digital infrastructure may offer enhanced ways to achieve these same goals while addressing the limitations of traditional approaches.

## Reimagining trust through emergent scholarship principles

The principles of emergent scholarship offer a framework for reimagining trust in academic communication—not by rejecting traditional elements, but by enhancing them through connection, openness, community, and engagement.

**Knowledge through connection** transforms isolated peer review into networked dialogue. Traditional peer review typically involves a small number of anonymous reviewers providing one-time feedback on nearly-completed work. This closed circuit limits the perspectives that shape scholarly development. In contrast, emergent scholarship emphasises that "valuable insights emerge at the intersection of different perspectives and disciplines" and that "understanding develops through both formal and informal exchanges across networks." By opening feedback channels and facilitating connections across disciplinary and institutional boundaries, we can create more robust quality assessment while accelerating knowledge development.

**Innovation through openness** addresses limitations in traditional gatekeeping models. When scholarship is "making knowledge as open and accessible as possible" and "benefiting from early sharing and continuous feedback," it creates opportunities for unexpected insights that might never emerge in closed systems. Traditional publishing models often restrict access to work until it has passed through gatekeeping mechanisms, limiting the diversity of perspectives that might identify flaws or suggest improvements. Emergent scholarship reverses this approach, using transparency to enhance integrity rather than positioning selectivity as the primary trust mechanism.

**Identity through community** shifts trust from institutional affiliations to networked relationships. Traditional scholarship often relies on institutional proxies for trustworthiness—the journal's reputation, the university affiliation, the citation count. Emergent scholarship recognises that trust can also emerge through "building supportive environments that foster collective meaning-making" and "creating spaces where scholars develop and transform their professional identities." This approach values "collaborative achievements alongside individual contributions," creating a more nuanced trust infrastructure that encompasses both individual expertise and collective wisdom.

**Value through engagement** offers alternatives to traditional impact metrics. Citation counts and journal impact factors provide limited views of scholarly contribution, often privileging established voices and conventional approaches. Emergent scholarship proposes "developing multiple approaches to evaluating scholarly contributions" and "moving beyond citation metrics to more holistic assessments of value." By viewing "impact as an ongoing dialogue rather than a terminal outcome," we can create more meaningful measures of scholarly contribution.

Perhaps most fundamentally, **meaning through medium** recognises that how we share knowledge shapes the knowledge itself. Traditional publishing treats the medium as neutral, emphasising content over form. Yet emergent scholarship acknowledges that "the medium shapes the message and influences how it's received." When we "employ diverse formats to enhance understanding and engagement," we not only make knowledge more accessible but potentially more impactful. The technical infrastructure of scholarship is not merely a delivery system but an integral part of how knowledge is constructed, shared, and trusted.

## Bridging traditional and emergent models: A technical framework

Building bridges between traditional and emergent scholarship requires a framework that honours both approaches—maintaining what works in established practices while embracing the possibilities of connection, openness, and engagement. The three-tier model I propose offers such a bridge:

1. **Live workspace**: A dynamic environment where scholarship evolves through visible iteration and open dialogue
2. **Preprint with DOI**: A stable snapshot that enables persistent citation while maintaining connection to ongoing development
3. **Journal publication**: Traditional recognition that connects emergent work to established academic incentive structures

This approach maintains compatibility with traditional academic structures while introducing new possibilities for knowledge development. The live workspace enables the openness, connection, and continuous dialogue that emergent scholarship values. The preprint with DOI provides the persistent identification and version control that traditional scholarship requires. Journal publication acknowledges the continuing reality of academic incentive structures while potentially influencing their evolution.

The technical implementation of this framework requires infrastructure that supports:

1. **Visible evolution**: Making the development of ideas transparent through accessible version history
2. **Open dialogue**: Enabling diverse perspectives to contribute to knowledge refinement
3. **Persistent identification**: Ensuring stable references for citation and discovery
4. **Contextual connection**: Situating work within broader scholarly conversations
5. **Multiple representations**: Presenting knowledge in formats appropriate to different audiences and contexts

This framework represents not a replacement for traditional trust mechanisms but an enhancement that addresses their limitations while preserving their strengths. It recognises that trust in scholarship emerges not only from pre-publication gatekeeping but from ongoing dialogue, visible evolution, and networked assessment.

## Implementation example: GitHub, Netlify, and Zenodo

While this conceptual framework could be implemented through various technical stacks, my implementation using GitHub, Netlify, and Zenodo demonstrates how these principles can be operationalised in practice.

**Version control through Git** provides complete transparency into the evolution of ideas. Every change is documented, attributed, and reversible, creating a visible record of how scholarship develops over time. This addresses limitations in traditional publishing, where the messy, iterative process of knowledge development is hidden behind a polished final product. By making revision history accessible, this approach supports the emergent scholarship principle that "creating connections that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries" leads to stronger knowledge.

**Open peer review through GitHub Issues** transforms assessment from gatekeeping to dialogue. Anyone can raise questions, suggest improvements, or offer alternative perspectives—all within a public forum that documents the conversation. Contributors can be identified through persistent GitHub accounts, creating accountability while expanding participation beyond traditional reviewer roles. This implements the principle that "innovation through openness" creates "conditions for unexpected connections and emergent insights."

**DOI integration through Zenodo** maintains persistent identification for scholarly citation. Even as the live document continues to evolve, specific versions receive stable identifiers that enable traditional academic practices of citation and attribution. This bridges between emergent and traditional scholarship, supporting both ongoing development and stable reference points. It acknowledges the principle of "identity through community" by providing mechanisms for appropriate attribution while enabling collaborative development.

**Netlify deployment** creates accessible, living documents that remain connected to their developmental history. Unlike traditional PDF publication, which separates the artifact from its context, this approach maintains the link between published content and the conversations that shaped it. This supports the principle that "medium shapes the message," recognising that how we share knowledge influences how it's understood and trusted.

This implementation demonstrates how emergent scholarship principles can be operationalised without abandoning traditional academic needs. The GitHub repository becomes both a workspace for development and a transparent record of evolution. Zenodo provides the persistence required for academic citation. Netlify creates accessible presentations appropriate for diverse audiences. Together, they form a bridge between established academic practice and emerging possibilities.

Most importantly, this approach shifts trust from pre-publication gatekeeping to visible process. Rather than asking readers to trust that appropriate assessment has occurred behind closed doors, it invites them to examine the developmental dialogue directly. This transparency doesn't eliminate the need for expertise—indeed, it makes expert contribution more visible and potentially more valuable.

## Conclusion

Trust in academic scholarship has traditionally been outsourced to publishers and journals, who served as gatekeepers and validators of knowledge. This system emerged from practical necessities in pre-digital scholarship and developed mechanisms that continue to serve important functions: persistent identification, version control, peer feedback, and contextual placement.

Yet emerging technologies and evolving scholarly practices offer opportunities to enhance these trust mechanisms through principles of connection, openness, community, and engagement. By building bridges between traditional and emergent models, we can create a scholarly trust infrastructure that preserves what works while addressing limitations.

The technical framework and implementation described here demonstrate one approach to creating such bridges. By combining version control, open dialogue, persistent identification, and accessible presentation, this approach maintains compatibility with traditional academic incentives while introducing new possibilities for knowledge development.

What emerges is not a replacement for traditional scholarship but an evolution—one that shifts trust from institutional proxies to visible processes, from closed assessment to open dialogue, from finished products to evolving knowledge. This approach doesn't demand abandoning established academic practices but instead offers a path for their gradual transformation through the principles of emergent scholarship.

As we navigate this transition, we have an opportunity to reimagine trust in academic communication—not by rejecting what came before, but by building upon it to create scholarship that is more connected, open, engaged, and ultimately more trustworthy.
