Here are several conceptually similar highlights to your example about the circular justification of homework, the unreasonable difficulty or clarity of assignments, and the resulting burden on children and their families. The following selections come from a range of documents and perspectives across your highlights:

1. On the Prevalence of Busywork and Lack of Meaningful Justification:
   - Assignments that add no value and seem designed for process rather than learning are criticized in [this analysis of "value-sucking" assignments](https://readwise.io/bookreview/14915625/?highlight=313524572): “They’re assignments that add no value to the world – after a student spends three hours creating it, a teacher spends 30 minutes grading it, and then the student throws it away. Not only do these assignments add no value to the world, they actually suck value out of the world.”

2. On the Frustration of Instructions and Student Understanding:
   - The challenge of unclear instructions is highlighted, noting that “[each and every aspect of the assignment that could impact a student’s grade has to be clearly spelled out in the instructions] in order for students to be able to do the work well (and for you to be able to grade the work fairly). And when your instructions are sufficiently detailed for students to do the work, the instructions are also sufficiently detailed for an LLM to do it” ([Why It Might Be Impossible to ‘AI-Proof’ Written Assignments](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42114118/?highlight=759116720)).

   - Another selection discusses the consequences of unclear curriculum design and communication: “If students and their parents don't understand the focus and purpose of a curriculum, then engagement is almost impossible” ([Storyboarding Your Curriculum](https://readwise.io/bookreview/24213719/?highlight=505355784)).

3. On the Wasted Time and Loss of Creative Learning:
   - The question is raised: “[By time spent, what percentage of the typical school experience is spent on: tests, test prep, comportment, homework, memorization... And what percentage is spent on daydreaming, inventing, creating from scratch, doing it without a manual and finding new solutions to difficult problems?](https://readwise.io/bookreview/4682342/?highlight=87274669)” This critique echoes the original's skepticism regarding how much actual learning is intended vs. how much is simply ritual.

4. On Assignments as Compliance Rather Than Learning:
   - John Gatto’s critique lists how much of school is focused on compliance rather than meaningful learning, describing how “[good students wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. This is the most important lesson of all: we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. Curiosity has no important place, only conformity](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770463).”

5. On Assignments Feeling Like Pointless Busywork:
   - Students express their frustration and disengagement with work that feels artificial or motiveless: “There are so many reasons why students cheat. They might be struggling with the material and unable to get the help they need. Maybe they have too much homework and not enough time to do it. Or maybe assignments feel like pointless busywork” ([What Do AI Chatbots Really Mean for Students and Cheating?](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41640117/?highlight=736032427)).

6. On Confusion, Blame, and Expectations in the Student-Teacher Dynamic:
   - “If not knowing what you believe you are supposed to know has habitually been a shameful experience as a learner, then one coping strategy may be to conceal your doubt and ignorance... They may expect the tutor to tell it again: ‘my learning is dependent on the effectiveness of your transmission teaching – you must deliver it to me in better ways’” ([Developing Inquiry for Learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770308)). This connects to the sense of assignments being mystifying and parents needing to walk children through unclear tasks in your selected text.

Each of these highlights resonates with the themes of your original: work as process for process’ sake, confusing requirements, assignments disconnected from real learning, and the shifting of responsibility onto families when clarity or pedagogical purpose is lacking.
