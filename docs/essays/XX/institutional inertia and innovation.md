Your original highlight questions the degree to which universities have actually attempted meaningful innovation or reform over several years. Here are conceptually similar highlights from your library, each reflecting on institutional inertia, resistance to meaningful change, or the superficiality of institutional responses—often specifically in higher education:

1. The observation that "we operate in a conservative system in which change is slow and blocked in large part by a fundamentally broken system of researcher incentives and rewards" directly addresses the institutional resistance to trying new approaches and the structural obstacles to innovation in academia. ([Does Scholarly Publishing Have an Innovation Problem?](https://readwise.io/bookreview/20323726/?highlight=408510133))

2. Another example comments that "education is highly institutionalised... It is these deeply embedded practices, strict hierarchies, bottlenecks and bureaucracy that make it difficult to adapt to new realities. One such reality is AI." This highlights the slow-moving, tradition-bound nature of universities and their collective inability to respond decisively to change. ([Worrying Data on How Students & Institutions Are Dealing With AI](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42962581/?highlight=755330517))

3. A related critique notes that "universities do many things well, but acting decisively as a system in response to new technologies is not one of them," referencing universities’ under-preparation for online learning despite long-standing technological trends. ([SAIL: We Should All Be AI-first](https://readwise.io/bookreview/27839790/?highlight=531167974))

4. This analysis points out that "existing promotion criteria often don’t reward experimentation, trying out new ideas (in research or teaching), and I may even say, from experience, that they tend to inhibit any innovation drive, for fear that it may have negative consequences for career progression," directly mirroring frustration with the lack of genuine institutional effort or risk-taking. ([Are Universities Learning Organisations?](https://readwise.io/bookreview/26937577/?highlight=516663139))

5. An even broader institutional critique states that "institutions of higher education are invested in keeping their scholars and those scholars' intellectual products limited and cloistered," which aligns with the idea of universities resisting meaningful reform or broader change. ([The Open Scholar](https://readwise.io/bookreview/8637192/?highlight=167253559))

6. Illustrating a general institutional pattern, another highlight notes: "institutions like schooling and medicine had a tendency to end up working in ways that reversed their original purpose," echoing sentiments about universities failing to actually tackle their systemic problems. ([Ivan Illich: deschooling, conviviality and lifelong learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42261422/?highlight=745010060))

7. And, from a different context but with a similar theme: "educational institutions respond by equal measures of pattern language, convening summits, commissioning white papers... the output and outcomes of all this activity take the form of reports, visualizations, and slide decks ... proof of concept of a continuous organizational strategy simultaneously anathema to the work of the university." This highlights the preference for performative action over substantive change. ([AI and the University as a Service](https://readwise.io/bookreview/45371870/?highlight=804713072))

Together, these highlights from your library show a strong thematic resonance with your selected passage: skepticism and frustration with the slow, superficial, or performative reforms in academic institutions, and their tendency to avoid truly innovative or disruptive change.
