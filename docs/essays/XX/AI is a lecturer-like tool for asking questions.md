Here are several conceptually similar highlights from different documents in your collection that echo the idea of AI acting as a judgment-free, always-available resource for questions—paralleling the “ask the professor without social cost” analogy:

- The sentiment that “many learners are reluctant to ask their tutor, lecturer, manager or boss questions, for fear of embarrassment, as it may reveal their lack of knowledge. Others are simply quiet, even introverts. Anonymous learning, through a chatbot, then becomes a virtue not a vice” mirrors the lack of social cost and fear of asking “stupid questions” found in the original text, showing how AI-mediated environments democratize question-asking ([Donald Clark on chat replacing human activity](https://readwise.io/bookreview/26248381/?highlight=506352603)).

- Similarly, “Learners felt more comfortable seeking clarifications from AI tutors than human tutors, perceiving AI tutors as less formal and less likely to induce fears of judgement” underscores how AI reduces the social anxieties tied to curiosity and learning ([AI tutors as less judgmental](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41616366/?highlight=735710628)).

- This idea is extended by the notion that “You can even practice exams with open input and dialogue. You can ask for hints but the standard of dialogue is superb. This is where it gets interesting, like a full discussion with a good teacher, who knows every subject, in remarkable detail, available 24/7/365, all the way up to College level” ([the universal teacher, available all the time](https://readwise.io/bookreview/26163001/?highlight=504958931)).

- The importance of being able to ask questions freely is also captured in “Let go of pride. Rapid learning often means asking stupid questions or making a fool of yourself,” emphasizing how removing barriers or judgment accelerates learning ([asking “stupid questions” as vital to learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/7377299/?highlight=137266744)).

- One highlight reflects on shy students staying after class to “ask questions without other people being around,” drawing a close analogy to the way AI lowers social inhibition ([shy students and private question-asking](https://readwise.io/bookreview/17127708/?highlight=352270092)).

- Another highlight notes, “On YouTube, a conversational AI tool makes it possible to figuratively ‘raise your hand’ while watching academic videos to ask clarifying questions, get helpful explanations or take a quiz on what you’ve been learning,” again capturing the “AI as always-available, low-friction question channel” ([conversational AI for academic videos](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41585080/?highlight=735213290)). 

Collectively, these highlights show a broad recognition—across different writers and perspectives—of how AI, like in your original Zvi Mowshowitz highlight, enables “asking any questions you like without interrupting the class or paying any social costs,” removing barriers and opening continual, private, and empowered access to expertise.

Here are more conceptually similar highlights from your collection that echo the theme of active engagement with AI tools as an integral part of the modern educational experience—especially in the context of lectures or learning situations:

1. On YouTube, a conversational AI tool now makes it possible to “raise your hand” during academic videos—letting learners ask clarifying questions, get extra explanations, or quiz themselves, even with long lectures. This is enabled by Gemini’s long-context capabilities, directly paralleling the idea of expecting students to interact with AI during learning sessions rather than passively consuming information ([see this highlight on Gemini’s use as an interactive learning companion](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41585080/?highlight=735213290)).

2. Instructors note that "the capacity of the AI to act as a tutor and mentor" is helping students connect concepts and deepen understanding, which demonstrates how AI isn't just a passive tool but an active facilitator in the learning process ([AI as tutor and mentor](https://readwise.io/bookreview/40352600/?highlight=758739923)).

3. Student learning with generative AI is seen as both an opportunity and a risk, but the opportunity lies in how students can engage with and even misuse gen AI in assessment contexts—again, indicating that active interaction with such tools is not only possible but relevant for learning ([generative AI and student learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/44861125/?highlight=797100091)).

4. Another direction: At Morehouse College, the mere presence of "AI teaching assistants" provokes skepticism about clinging to classroom tradition rather than exploring new ways AI can be useful—mirroring the rhetorical challenge, “what are you even doing?” if you’re ignoring these new possibilities ([skepticism over traditional classroom vs. AI utility](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42277949/?highlight=745232837)).

5. Some platforms highlight how, “people treat AI like Google, asking it factual questions,” but the real power emerges in using AI for genuine dialogue and exploration during learning, rather than just as a repository for answers ([AI as thinking partner, not just a search engine](https://readwise.io/bookreview/46497550/?highlight=820373832)).

6. In the context of YouTube academic videos (and lectures), the ability to “raise your hand” and interact with AI in real-time is positioned as a transformative feature for curiosity and understanding ([raise your hand while watching lectures](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41585080/?highlight=735213290)).

7. Activities where students prompt ChatGPT, rephrase to get nuanced replies, and then critique and build essays from this AI-material showcase not just passive reception but active, iterative engagement with AI—akin to always wanting to ask the AI a question in class ([students refine prompts and critique AI’s output](https://readwise.io/bookreview/46501520/?highlight=820429921)).

8. Educational researchers are actively building conversational agents and chatbots that “engage in discussions with students... to support student-to-student collaboration", underscoring the philosophy that not engaging with these tools amounts to missing the point of their educational promise ([chatbots for engagement and collaboration](https://readwise.io/bookreview/4459677/?highlight=84508780)).

All these selections illustrate the growing consensus (as in the highlighted Zvi Mowshowitz text) that, in 21st-century learning, it’s almost expected that students would interact with AI tools for questioning, dialogue, and deeper engagement—passively consuming a lecture without such engagement is starting to feel outdated or like a missed opportunity.
