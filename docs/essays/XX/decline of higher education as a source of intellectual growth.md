Here are some conceptually similar highlights to your selected text about the decline of college's role as a place of genuine intellectual growth, drawn from your collection but from different documents:

1. The sense that universities have drifted away from fostering profound intellectual engagement is echoed in the observation that modern institutions are often criticized for their desire to micro-manage academic work, which has contributed to "an apparent decline in the role and importance of the public intellectual." This management is "viewed as a nail in the coffin of the traditional wide-ranging intellectual unafraid to speak truth to power" — reflecting a broad, lamented diminishment of intellectual vibrancy within universities. See this critique of the [decline of the public intellectual within universities](https://readwise.io/bookreview/16552389/?highlight=341791695).

2. More cynically, some see universities as "[primarily being a Bryan Caplan style set of signaling mechanisms](https://readwise.io/bookreview/51285346/?highlight=887805536)" (from the same document, included here in case you want another angle), suggesting that their focus is no longer on actual learning or intellectual growth but on demonstrating compliance for external validation.

3. On a related theme, the [purpose of education](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11957991/?highlight=251183949) is powerfully reframed by bell hooks: "The purpose of education... is critical thinking. Requiring ‘courage and imagination,’ the ‘heartbeat of critical thinking is the longing to know — to understand how life works.’" The implication is that when this longing is lost or displaced, so too is the deeper purpose of college.

4. A practical illustration of how university experience has shifted is described here: "whenever I got a syllabus in college, 25% of it was about the content of the class, and 75% of it was about how I could acquire points," highlighting how the educational process has become instrumentalized and reduced to point-scoring rather than engagement with ideas. See [this reflection on college syllabi](https://readwise.io/bookreview/30565432/?highlight=570386307).

5. Relatedly, there is a sense among students themselves that "there is just box-ticking going on... and getting a degree at the end of it," again suggesting that the deeper, more profound aspects of intellectual growth are being supplanted by mere credentialism. See [this student perspective](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41312026/?highlight=731156579).

6. Some critics go further, lamenting that higher education "has been reduced to a private good, now available almost exclusively to those with the financial means... There is little interest in understanding the pedagogical foundation of higher education as a deeply civic and political project that provides the conditions for individual autonomy and takes liberation and the practice of freedom as a collective goal." This reflects the commercialization and narrowing of the university mission, seen in [Giroux on the loss of higher education’s civic purpose](https://readwise.io/bookreview/4459355/?highlight=84506730).

7. A university professor notes that the "[meaningful assignments and assessments... have become too easily cheatable](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41476245/?highlight=733931648)," expressing concern that authentic learning is being crowded out or rendered obsolete.

8. Another observation points toward the commodification of education: "many young peoples’ attitudes towards university education had fundamentally changed... 'I pay high fees, I’ve bought this degree.' There is a sense of entitlement, it feels very disheartening." This quote underscores the transactional, rather than transformational, view that now pervades higher education. See [this commentary on changing student attitudes](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41312026/?highlight=731156801).

These highlights, across different authors and contexts, converge on the idea that the core intellectual mission of colleges and universities has eroded in recent times, replaced by credentialism, bureaucracy, and instrumentalization — and that this process was underway well before the advent of generative AI like ChatGPT.
