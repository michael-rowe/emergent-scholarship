Here are several conceptually similar highlights from different documents that echo the central concerns of your highlighted text: the idea that AI is not merely undermining assessment protocols in higher education, but is fundamentally devaluing the market signal and financial value of college degrees and traditional skill sets:

1. In "Mary Meaker's Tech Report 'AI & Universities' Is Right but Delusional," Donald Clark argues that higher education, especially at the elite end, is facing a "crisis of relevance" and risks becoming "even more of an expensive rite of passage for the rich" if it doesn't adapt to the changing technological landscape and market demands. This reflects concern about the erosion of real value and the purely signaling or ceremonial function of degrees in the AI era [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42113776/?highlight=742839957), [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42113776/?highlight=742840584).

2. "[The idea that AI is liberating access to intelligence from the shackles of a market-driven system](https://readwise.io/bookreview/50653806/?highlight=878986578) is, of course, deeply contentious," writes Andrew Maynard. He challenges readers to consider what skills will actually matter for students in a future where "intelligence is effectively free," suggesting that the core value traditionally associated with higher education is in jeopardy [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/50653806/?highlight=878986578). 

3. A related point is made by Megan McArdle, who warns that "a degree obtained by AI does not signal the information they are trying to convey, so its value is likely to collapse quickly as employers get wise. There will be a lag, because cultural habits die hard, but eventually the whole enterprise will implode unless they figure out how to teach something that employers will pay a premium for" [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/51285346/?highlight=887808519).

4. Donald Clark also questions whether AI might make obtaining degrees largely redundant for certain professions, stating: "If GPT-4 performs at this level in the exams across the undergraduate degree, then it is reasonable, if not likely, [to expect the technology to do a passable job now in jobs that require a psychology degree. Do we really need to put hundreds of thousands of young people through a full degree in this subject at such expense](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41846234/?highlight=739116430) and with subsequent student debts when many of the tasks are likely to be seriously affected by AI?"

5. In the SAIL: Sensemaking AI Learning newsletter, a report highlights that "employer demand for many skill sets that AI can assist with to some degree — such as coding in Javascript — is declining fast, while demand for many skills that make use of AI — or are hard for AI to do (like sports coaching or ecological restoration) — is booming," mirroring the idea that old degree signals and skill sets are rapidly losing economic value [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41585083/?highlight=735213303).

6. Andy Beggan, quoted in Times Higher Education, remarks that universities are in a “hype cycle” with AI, noting that it’s only after that moment ends that "the real value of AI and how it can be leveraged can begin to be understood without 'overestimating' its impact" — hinting at future value shifts and the current devaluation crisis within higher education [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/39793006/?highlight=709063640).

7. George Siemens documents how universities are now compelled to undertake "radical responses" due to "mounting public calls for accountability, and growing questions about the utility of a traditional college/university degree" — much of which is driven by rapid technological change, including AI [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/27171717/?highlight=520490737).

8. David White, in "How Technology Redefines Learning," makes it explicit: "AI reduces the value of synthesis as a skill," directly addressing how the capabilities once conferred by a degree are now automated and devalued in the marketplace [[link]](https://readwise.io/bookreview/22176138/?highlight=527026287).

These highlights collectively reinforce the core idea that the rise of AI is not just a challenge to assessment security in academia, but a fundamental devaluation of what higher education credentials have previously signaled to employers and the broader market.
