Here are several conceptually similar highlights from your collection that reflect on universities' responses (or lack thereof) to the AI cheating epidemic—capturing themes of institutional passivity, denial, or misplaced focus:

1. The “arms race” between technology-enabled cheating and university responses is described as just one part of broader issues, highlighting institutional struggle or resignation rather than proactive change:  
   The focus on academic integrity violations in the era of GenAI tools is “one node in a network of existing conversations regarding the accelerating pace of digitalisation in HE and the resultant likelihood of what Dawson calls ‘e-cheating’…” ([AI Assessment Scale](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41223695/?highlight=730164231)).

2. Another highlight underscores higher education’s reaction being mostly a narrow fixation on plagiarism, which is described as “a pile of negativity expressed thinly veiled as ‘ethics’,” suggesting avoidance or superficiality rather than true engagement with the challenge ([Mary Meaker's Tech Report 'AI & Universities' Is Right but Delusional](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42113776/?highlight=742839721)).

3. Matthew Kirschenbaum identifies the “incapacity of educational institutions… to be meaningfully responsive to the sociotechnical situation—responsive in a manner other than denial, prohibition, capitalization, and capitulation.” This considers colleges going through the motions but not actually tackling the root of the issue ([AI and the University as a Service](https://readwise.io/bookreview/45371870/?highlight=804713378)).

4. Donald Clark observes that universities’ reactions “is often to simply reject out of hand, categorise it as cheating or get obsessed about fictional ethical issues. After 40 years… I’ve seen it many times before, with email, photocopiers, calculators, computers, internet…”—highlighting a pattern of dismissiveness or inertia ([Worrying Data on How Students & Institutions Are Dealing With AI](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42962581/?highlight=755330549)).

5. Times Higher Education’s reporting notes that institutions “would have been better being ‘honest’ that they were still figuring out the ramifications of new technologies,” suggesting a lack of open, proactive communication with students ([Universities’ ChatGPT Misconduct Focus ‘Panicked Students’](https://readwise.io/bookreview/39793006/?highlight=709061620)).

These highlights align well with your original passage, emphasizing the themes of universities being slow to act, preoccupied with surface-level solutions, or resigned to changes brought by AI—rather than taking decisive, systemic action.
