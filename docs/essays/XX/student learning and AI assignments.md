Here are several highlights from your collection that are conceptually similar to Zvi Mowshowitz’s reflection on the educational response to AI—namely, grappling with enforcing independent student learning, redesigning assessment, and the prospect of embracing AI as a learning partner:

1. **On redesigning assessment and tasks in the face of AI**: 
   - Tony Bates poses crucial questions for educators about what kinds of tasks require students to think independently, how AI can be constructively used to facilitate learning, and how to assess learning in a world where students and instructors have access to advanced tools. This reflects the need to thoughtfully design learning and assessment, as Mowshowitz suggests: [What learning tasks should we set for students that require them to think for themselves...and how can we use these tools in a constructive way?](https://readwise.io/bookreview/25721841/?highlight=497781309)

2. **On the shift from bans/enforcement to integration**:
   - Mark notes the move in higher education from calls for bans and returns to in-person assessment towards a more "nuanced debate involving assessment reform and incorporating AI literacy into the curriculum," so students are prepared for a world where such tools are ubiquitous. This frames the discussion as a choice between restriction and constructive adaptation: [Assessment reform and incorporating AI literacy into the curriculum](https://readwise.io/bookreview/34219451/?highlight=627155611).

3. **On embracing AI for new forms of practice**:
   - Lilach and Ethan Mollick describe the opportunity to use AI for simulations, mentoring, and co-creation, offering prompts that can be customized for novel educational tasks. This embodies Mowshowitz’s notion of embracing AI and designing new assignments to help students learn in partnership with technology: [AI-based exercises that enable novel forms of practice and application including simulations, mentoring, coaching, and co-creation](https://readwise.io/bookreview/40352600/?highlight=717286568).

4. **On authentic, real-world assessment vs. traditional proctored testing**:  
   - An article from eLearningInside News articulates the value of authentic assessments over rote memorization and traditional tests, advocating for assignments that mirror real-life demands—this resonates with both the “forcing function” of traditional assessment and the “other advantages” of in-person work referenced by Mowshowitz: [Create real world assignments that match what students will see on the job or in life](https://readwise.io/bookreview/8656624/?highlight=167765601).

5. **On human-AI collaboration as the new norm**:
   - Adam Bridgeman suggests that "human-AI collaborations are likely to be the norm," so educators should consider how to embrace AI in assessment, echoing Mowshowitz’s advice that “the way” forward is designing tasks that harness AI as a partner in learning: [Start thinking about how to embrace AI as part of assessment](https://readwise.io/bookreview/38945758/?highlight=696744088).

6. **On giving students agency and critical awareness in using AI**:  
   - Mike Perkins, Leon Furze, Jasper Roe, and Jason MacVaugh discuss involving students in decisions about how to use GenAI for assessment, directly involving learners in determining what role AI should play—an echo of the shift from merely policing usage to co-creating norms and tasks: [Engaging students in a clear discussion of where AI is and is not appropriate for each task may contribute to students harnessing these technologies effectively and ethically](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41223695/?highlight=730409250).

7. **On flexible frameworks for integrating or excluding AI in assignments**:
   - The same authors propose a graduated scale where, for some assignments, students are barred from using AI and must work solely from their own knowledge, while in others they are expected or encouraged to use AI, but must also critically assess its outputs. This parallels the options enumerated by Mowshowitz: [Level 1: No AI...Level 4: AI Task Completion, Human Evaluation](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41223695/?highlight=730374150), [Level 5: Full AI](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41223695/?highlight=730384351).

8. **On leveraging both human and AI strengths to unlock student potential**:  
   - Andrew Maynard frames the educator’s challenge as creating environments that combine human and artificial intelligence to unlock learning, which encapsulates the “third way” Mowshowitz presents: [How we create learning environments that leverage both human and artificial intelligence](https://readwise.io/bookreview/50653806/?highlight=878986733).

9. **On moving beyond preserving old assignments to ambitious new pedagogies**:
   - Ethan Mollick writes that the AI moment is not about clinging to old assignment types, but about inventing new pedagogies that push students further—a parallel to Mowshowitz’s vision of embracing AI for improved learning tasks: [AI provides the chance to generate new approaches to pedagogy that push students in ambitious ways](https://readwise.io/bookreview/40608897/?highlight=720855384).

These highlights collectively map the main themes of Mowshowitz’s passage—assessment as enforcement vs. opportunity, authentic task design, and adaptation to AI’s presence in learning—across a diverse range of educational thinkers and sources.
