Here are some conceptually similar highlights from your saved content that echo Zvi Mowshowitz’s skepticism about the inherent value of degrees, integrity in education, and the potential positive outcomes from disrupting the existing system:

1. Ivan Illich critiques how educational institutions conflate form with substance, arguing that credentials and diplomas become stand-ins for actual competence or learning: learners get “schooled” to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. Imagination, he argues, is “schooled” to accept service in place of value, leading to a society that mistakes institutional performance for real human development ([Illich on deschooling](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42261422/?highlight=745010388)).

2. Similarly, Peter Ovens et al. argue that modern education is “more like training than education,” rewarding predictability and conformity. The degree system, in this view, creates “a heavy dependency on authority and a tendency for a deep fear of failure,” resulting in “the effective delivery of commodified achievement rather than being enabled to achieve autonomous powers of personal and professional development” ([critique of degree-driven training](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770457)).

3. John Holt (via Jesse Stommel) takes issue with the competitive, credential-driven nature of education, seeing it as “the most authoritarian and dangerous of all the social inventions.” He contends that genuine agency and self-actualization are not possible within systems that prioritize competitive ranking and credentialism ([competitive schooling and credentialism](https://readwise.io/bookreview/4459733/?highlight=84509050)).

4. Diana Laurillard offers a more structural take, observing that university education is subject to economic, personal, and social pressures, with “main pressures on the curriculum deriving from the aims to: inspire and enable individuals to develop their...” ([roles for a university education](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940891/?highlight=250770133)). This invites skepticism of whether degrees reflect these aims or primarily function as social markers.

5. The rise of AI and automated systems even further undermines the value traditionally ascribed to university degrees: the same AI that can pass your college classes is “radically devaluing the skills that a college degree... used to convey in the market,” suggesting an impending collapse in the signaling power of degrees ([AI and the collapse of degree value, per Yglesias](https://readwise.io/bookreview/51285346/?highlight=887808542), [McArdle’s pessimism about degrees as signals](https://readwise.io/bookreview/51285346/?highlight=887808519)).

6. Illich also calls for deinstitutionalization and convivial forms of education as a response to systemic failures—insisting that entrenched models of bureaucratic accreditation are, at best, obstacles to genuine learning and opportunity ([deinstitutionalization as solution](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42261422/?highlight=745194593)).

7. One highlight notes how many students themselves recognize the “box-ticking” nature of university, seeing their degree primarily as a purchased commodity rather than an educational experience ([students’ attitudes to “buying” degrees](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41312026/?highlight=731156801), [box-ticking and degree completion](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41312026/?highlight=731156579)).

Taken together, these highlights suggest a broad skepticism about the status quo in higher education—a skepticism that aligns closely with Zvi’s observations about integrity, learning, and the real value of degrees, and occasionally even welcomes the disruption of the current credential-centric system.
