> the kids know the assignments are stupid and fake.

1. In an article about the impact of AI on student cheating, it's noted that "assignments feel like pointless busywork," recognizing that such tasks often lack meaning for the students themselves [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/41640117/?highlight=736032427).

2. The idea is echoed in a discussion of open pedagogy, where some assignments are described as "[adding] no value to the world," with the further critique that "they actually suck value out of the world"—underscoring the perception by both students and educators of their meaninglessness [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/14915625/?highlight=313524572).

3. Steve Krause writes about how "cheating is far more 'sensible' when the work is clearly busy work, with little value," highlighting the link between student disengagement and inauthentic or pointless assignments [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/24967515/?highlight=485883091).

4. In a reflective piece on student assessment, it’s argued that, "if a student has nowhere in their university assessment a chance to recognise their work as socially useful... this is a very diminished educational experience"—a perspective that connects students’ skepticism to a lack of authenticity and utility in their work [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/8088489/?highlight=153231384).

5. Another insight, from Donald Clark, pinpoints the sense of irrelevance felt by many: "A lot of what learners are doing in school, college or work has started to seem a little predictable, tired, often irrelevant. All of that time writing essays, doing maths you’ll never use" [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/43929188/?highlight=783306307).

6. A critical theory perspective underscores the problem: "students must understand an assessment system if they are expected to flourish within it"—implying that assignments divorced from real meaning are easily seen through and dismissed by students [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/8088489/?highlight=153231379).

7. Lastly, on the topic of disposable assignments, the question is posed: "What if we changed 'disposable assignments' into activities which actually __added value to the world?__" This highlights a recognition that many current assignments are seen as lacking substance or purpose [in this highlight](https://readwise.io/bookreview/14915625/?highlight=313524573).

These selections collectively capture the sentiment that students often recognize traditional assignments as lacking authenticity or value, driving disengagement and, at times, academic dishonesty.
