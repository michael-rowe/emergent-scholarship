> the entire structure of school is based on the thesis that students need to be forced to learn, and that this learning must be constantly policed.

These come from a range of perspectives and sources, and question the underlying structure of formal schooling, its assumptions about student autonomy, and the prevalence of surveillance or control:

- Ivan Illich famously critiqued the “dominance of the school and institutionalized education,” arguing that it “has tended to obscure and undermine other everyday or ‘vernacular’ forms” of learning—implying that enforced and policed learning stifles natural, self-directed growth [[Illich: deschooling, conviviality and lifelong learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42261422/?highlight=745196164)].  
- The notion that “students have been subjected to a dependency model of learning: dependent upon teachers, and upon the resources they are given, with little emphasis on their own responsibility in the process, to develop their control, their autonomy,” mirrors your quote’s concerns about enforced learning [[Developing Inquiry for Learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770437)].
- John Gatto’s critique emphasizes that “good students wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. This is the most important lesson of all: we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives...Curiosity has no important place, only conformity” [[Developing Inquiry for Learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770463)].
- The structure of school is described as cultivating “attitudes of dependence and conformity,” in which students need only to “just get on and learn them” without question—a strong parallel to the idea that school’s whole structure is predicated on enforced, policed learning [[Developing Inquiry for Learning](https://readwise.io/bookreview/11940893/?highlight=250770304)].
- Adam Mastroianni takes up a policing metaphor, reflecting: “When every class begins with a ~20-page description of the academic panopticon students have to live inside for the next semester, I dunno, maybe that takes some of the fun out of learning?” [[I Wanted to Be a Teacher but They Made Me a Cop](https://readwise.io/bookreview/30565432/?highlight=570386777)].
- Relatedly, another highlight by Mastroianni asserts: “Enforcing these rules only makes me worse at teaching. If you’re into this stuff, guess what: you’re not a teacher, you’re a cop,” further drawing out the parallel between teaching as surveillance and law enforcement [[I Wanted to Be a Teacher but They Made Me a Cop](https://readwise.io/bookreview/30565432/?highlight=570389160)].
- In an anarchist critique, schools are described as “infused with authoritarian relationships between the student and teacher, they uphold corporate structures and are inundated with standardized curriculum. Under these particular state structures, teachers' work lacks autonomy and many...are forced to conform to curriculum standards, meritocracy, and quantitative outcomes” [[Anarchist Pedagogies](https://readwise.io/bookreview/42932466/?highlight=754873810)].
- Jesse Stommel critiques the “rude quantification of learning, the reduction of teaching to widgets and students to data points,” suggesting that the policing and enforcement inherent in educational structures dehumanize learning [[If Bell Hooks Made an LMS: Grades, Radical Openness, and Domain of One's Own](https://readwise.io/bookreview/15611225/?highlight=326262865)].

Collectively, these highlights show a breadth of critique—from compulsory learning being enforced at the cost of autonomy, to the reduction of education to surveillance and compliance, and the institutional structures that reinforce these logics.
