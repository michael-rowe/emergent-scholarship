Here are conceptually similar highlights from across your documents that echo or further develop the ideas found in your given text, about AI's impact on motivation, human skill development, academic integrity, and educational purpose:

1. **AI and Loss of Human Skill/Motivation**  
The concern that using AI for routine tasks leads to cognitive atrophy is shared in [Centaurs and Cyborgs on the Jagged Frontier](https://readwise.io/bookreview/33634552/?highlight=617815250), where recruiters relying on high-quality AI "became lazy, careless, and less skilled in their own judgment. They missed out on some brilliant applicants and made worse decisions... When the AI is very good, humans have no reason to work hard and pay attention. They let the AI take over, instead of using it as a tool. He called this 'falling asleep at the wheel', and it can hurt human learning, skill development, and productivity."

2. **Automating Tasks and Erosion of Experience**  
A similar concern is voiced in ["Generative AI can harm learning"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/46190684/?highlight=816342291): "When technology automates a task, humans can miss out on valuable experience performing that task. As a consequence, such a technology may induce a tradeoff where they improve performance on average, but introduce new failure cases due to reduced human skill."

3. **Self-Reflection on Assignments' Purpose**  
Echoing your question—"why are you assigning essays that AI can do for them, without convincing the students why they should still write the essays themselves?"—Ethan Mollick in ["The Homework Apocalypse"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/40608897/?highlight=720852464) notes: "Students will want to understand why they are doing assignments that seem obsolete thanks to AI. They will want to use AI as a learning companion, a co-author, or a teammate. They will want to accomplish more than they did before, and also want answers about what AI means for their future learning paths."

4. **Human Skills and the Purpose of Education in an AI World**  
Andrew Maynard, in ["Reimagining Learning and Education in an Age of AI"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/50653806/?highlight=878986859), argues: "advances in AI are fundamentally challenging both the *how* and the *why* of learning and education. If we are to realize the 'boundless possibilities' these challenges could lead to, we need to reimagine learning and education in an age of AI, or risk sacrificing what *could* be on the altar of a blind devotion to what *is*."

5. **AI Requiring a Rethink of Assessment**  
Addressing the futility of traditional assessments, ["What to Do About Assessments if We Can’t Out-Design or Out-Run AI?"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/38945758/?highlight=696744087) says: "It is becoming increasingly clear that there isn’t going to be a way to design take-home assessments that are ‘AI-proof’. Assessments that are authentic, or reflective, or personal, or contextualised, or multimodal, or localised – these can all be completed by new generations of generative AI."

6. **AI Creating Dependency and Reducing Learning Opportunities**  
A parallel is found even in AI's own advice, as in ["AI coding assistant refuses to write code, tells user to learn programming instead"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/51283588/?highlight=887779366): "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities."

7. **Job Satisfaction and Underutilization of Skills**  
In ["Wisereads Vol. 65"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/46067345/?highlight=814705214), the effect extends to professionals: "productivity significantly increases but job satisfaction may decline ... 82% of scientists report reduced satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization."

8. **Call for Authentic Assessments and Purposeful Education**  
An HE Policy Institute post, ["How are HE leaders responding to generative AI?"](https://readwise.io/bookreview/30042580/?highlight=562788840), echoes: "Focus on catching cheating is misplaced effort – we need to focus on making assessment more authentic and enhance opportunities for learning, with whatever tools are available.”

These highlights, from diverse contexts (recruitment, education, coding, science), all underscore your points: that heavy reliance on AI can disincentivize human effort, erode skills, and create existential questions about the purpose and design of learning in an AI-rich era. They also suggest the need to refocus education on what remains uniquely human, or on learning goals that AI cannot easily replace or automate.
