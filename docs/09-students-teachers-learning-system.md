# Students as Active Participants in the Emergent Scholarship Ecosystem

You've touched on something really important. Viewing emergent scholarship solely from an educator perspective would create the same hierarchical, one-directional flow of knowledge that these principles seek to transform. Positioning both students and teachers as co-participants in a learning ecosystem guided by these principles opens up much more powerful possibilities.

## Reimagining Student-Teacher Relationships Through Emergent Principles

### Knowledge Through Connection

**Traditional view:** Students connect to knowledge through teachers who serve as gatekeepers **Emergent ecosystem view:** Students and teachers both participate in networks where knowledge emerges through their interactions with each other and broader communities

Students might:

- Contribute unique perspectives that transform collective understanding
- Make connections across courses that faculty within siloed departments cannot see
- Bring contemporary experiences that update theoretical knowledge

### Information Flow Through Networks

**Traditional view:** Information flows from teacher to student **Emergent ecosystem view:** All participants both contribute to and draw from knowledge networks

Students might:

- Create and curate knowledge artifacts that become resources for peers and faculty
- Develop filtering strategies that faculty can learn from
- Build bridges between academic knowledge and community knowledge

### Identity Through Community

**Traditional view:** Students develop professional identity by modeling faculty **Emergent ecosystem view:** Identity develops through participation in mixed communities of practice

Students might:

- Co-create new forms of professional identity suited to emerging contexts
- Bring generational perspectives that help evolve professional identities
- Challenge faculty to reconsider aspects of professional identity that may no longer serve

### Innovation Through Openness

**Traditional view:** Faculty innovate curriculum; students adapt to innovations **Emergent ecosystem view:** Innovation emerges from all participants in open environments

Students might:

- Experiment with new learning approaches and share discoveries
- Bring familiarity with emerging tools and technologies
- Identify outdated practices that faculty have normalized

### Meaning Through Medium

**Traditional view:** Faculty select educational mediums; students consume through these channels **Emergent ecosystem view:** All participants contribute to decisions about how knowledge is expressed

Students might:

- Develop multimodal approaches to demonstrating understanding
- Help faculty navigate new communication platforms
- Identify when mediums are limiting rather than enhancing understanding

### Value Through Engagement

**Traditional view:** Faculty determine what has value; students align with these values **Emergent ecosystem view:** Value emerges through engagement of all participants

Students might:

- Bring perspectives on what outcomes matter in contemporary healthcare
- Identify misalignments between educational practices and future needs
- Contribute to new measures of educational impact

### Sustainability Through Ecology

**Traditional view:** Faculty design sustainable systems; students operate within them **Emergent ecosystem view:** All participants contribute to creating environments that sustain learning

Students might:

- Identify unsustainable practices that contribute to burnout
- Develop peer support systems that enhance resilience
- Bring fresh perspectives on balancing efficiency with wellbeing

## Practical Implications

This ecosystem view has several important implications:

1. **Curriculum co-creation** becomes necessary rather than optional, with students as partners in designing learning experiences
    
2. **Governance structures** evolve to include meaningful student participation in educational decision-making
    
3. **Assessment processes** shift to include student self-assessment and peer assessment as legitimate components
    
4. **Faculty development** includes learning from and with students, not just learning how to teach them
    
5. **Learning spaces** (physical and virtual) are designed to facilitate multi-directional knowledge exchange
    
6. **Educational research** positions students as co-investigators rather than subjects
    
7. **Technological choices** consider the varied perspectives and needs of all ecosystem participants
    

## A Concrete Example: Reimagining Clinical Learning

In a traditional model, clinical faculty determine learning objectives, demonstration methods, and evaluation criteria. Students rotate through predetermined experiences and are assessed against established competencies.

In an emergent ecosystem model:

- Student experiences become valuable data for curriculum refinement
- Patient perspectives inform what constitutes valuable learning
- Learning objectives emerge from authentic clinical questions
- Assessment includes how students contribute to team learning
- Multiple forms of expertise (including patient expertise) are recognized
- Technologies chosen support connections across the learning community
- The sustainability of the learning environment becomes everyone's responsibility

## The Book's Approach

This ecosystem perspective suggests your book might be most effective if it:

1. Uses inclusive language that addresses all participants in health professions education
2. Provides examples of principles in action from multiple perspectives
3. Includes voices and case stories from students, faculty, patients, and other stakeholders
4. Offers reflection questions relevant to different ecosystem participants
5. Presents frameworks that can be used by anyone in the system to advance emergent approaches

This approach doesn't diminish faculty expertise or responsibilityâ€”it contextualizes it within a richer ecosystem where learning emerges from interactions among all participants, guided by shared principles rather than hierarchical structures.

Would this ecosystem approach align with your vision for the book and for emergent scholarship in health professions education?
