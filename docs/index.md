::: tip Core principles

Emergent scholarship is built on seven interconnected principles:

- *Knowledge through connection*: Understanding emerges from relationships and interactions rather than residing solely in individual minds or isolated texts
- *Information flow through networks*: Information moves through formal and informal networks, creating new patterns and insights
- *Identity through community*: Professional identity forms through participation in multiple overlapping communities of practice
- *Innovation through openness*: Innovation emerges from environments where ideas can flow freely and evolve through collaboration
- *Meaning through medium*: The forms and formats we use to express knowledge shape understanding and learning
- *Value through engagement*: Worth is determined through meaningful impact and stakeholder engagement
- *Sustainability through ecology*: Learning environments must respect and enhance human and environmental resources
