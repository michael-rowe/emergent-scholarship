# What problem does it address?

Emergent scholarship responds to several challenges in contemporary knowledge creation, production, and dissemination (including teaching):

- Traditional scholarship often struggles with complex, interconnected problems that cross disciplinary boundaries
- transforms education from a lecturer-focused system of information delivery to a collaborative ecosystem where [student learning needs are prioritised](/essays/from-teaching-to-learning.md) and actively drive educational design
- The current academic system can create perverse incentives that [prioritise publication metrics over meaningful impact](/essays/publishing-with-purpose.md)
- Knowledge creation is increasingly disconnected from broader social discourse, with academics primarily talking to each other
- Conventional research processes can be rigid and slow to adapt to urgent societal challenges
- Many voices and perspectives remain marginalised in traditional scholarly practices
- The exponential growth of information makes it impossible for any individual to comprehensively master a field

Emergent scholarship aims to address the widening gap between how we teach within the formal education system, and what people actually need to thrive in society, which is increasingly characterised by unprecedented complexity, exponential knowledge growth, technological transformation, and system pressures.
