information yet under-prepared for complex practice environments. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being rapidly adopted by students, revealing fundamental gaps in traditional educational approaches. This paper introduces the ACADEMIC framework, a theoretically grounded approach to integrating AI into health professions education (HPE) that shifts focus from assessing outputs to supporting learning processes. Drawing on social constructivism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, and connectivism, I conducted a systematic analysis of learning interactions across six dimensions: power dynamics, knowledge representation, agency, contextual influence, identity formation, and temporality. From this analysis emerged seven principles that can be used to guide the integration of AI into HPE. Rather than viewing AI as a tool for efficient content delivery or a threat to academic integrity, the ACADEMIC framework positions AI as a partner in learning that can address longstanding challenges. The framework emphasises that most students are not natural autodidacts and need guidance in learning with AI rather than simply using it to produce better outputs. By reframing the relationship between students and AI, educators can create learning environments that more authentically prepare professionals for the complexity, uncertainty, and collaborative demands of contemporary healthcare practice.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Health professions education stands at a crossroads. Despite decades of innovation and reform, our education systems introduce a troubling tension: graduates who are simultaneously overwhelmed with information yet under-prepared for the complexity of modern practice. Typical approaches to learning and teaching, characterised by content overload, decontextualised knowledge, and assessment practices that reward recall over reasoning, are increasingly at odds with the realities of healthcare delivery.</p><p>The challenges are multifaceted and entrenched. Students struggle to integrate theoretical knowledge with clinical practice, while educators labour under curricular structures that fragment learning into discrete subjects and skills. Assessment practices often measure what is easy to evaluate rather than what is important to learn, focusing on outputs as proxies for what has been learned, rather than the processes of learning. Meanwhile, healthcare systems grow more complex, with expanding bodies of knowledge, evolving technologies, and increasing emphasis on interprofessional collaboration. The gap between how we educate and how professionals actually work widens, despite our best efforts to bridge it.</p><p>Artificial intelligence has entered this landscape not as a solution to these challenges, nor merely as another technology to integrate, but as a catalyst that prompts educators and students to reexamine fundamental assumptions about learning itself. Students are already widely using AI toolsâ€”with surveys showing adoption rates of 80-90%â€”as they explore concepts, practice reasoning, and prepare for assessments, regardless of whether educators have sanctioned or even acknowledged this use. Rather than focusing on how to control or limit this adoption, we might instead ask: What does students&#39; rapid embrace of AI reveal about the limitations of our current approaches? What needs are students attempting to meet through these tools? And most importantly, how might educators thoughtfully guide students in using AI to address long-standing educational challenges?</p><p>This paper proposes that addressing these questions requires us to examine four interrelated dimensions of learning in health professions education, through the lens of multiple theoretical perspectives. First, the <em>how</em> of learningâ€”the processes through which knowledge is constructed and capabilities are developed. Second, the <em>why</em> of learningâ€”the purpose and power dynamics that shape educational practices. Third, the <em>where</em> of learningâ€”the complex adaptive systems within which healthcare education and practice occur. And fourth, the <em>what</em> of learningâ€”the nature and organisation of knowledge in networked environments.</p><p>By integrating these theoretical perspectives, we can position students as active agents who learn to communicate effectively with AI tools as part of their learning. This approach moves beyond viewing AI as either a threat to be resisted or a panacea to be embraced. Instead, we see students and educators working with AI tools to address persistent challenges in how we prepare health professionals for the complexity, uncertainty, and interpersonal demands of contemporary practice.</p><p>Health professions education has long aspired to develop practitioners who can think critically, adapt to changing circumstances, collaborate effectively, and continue learning throughout their careers. The integration of AI into our educational practices offers an opportunity to pursue these aspirations in new waysâ€”not by automating or enhancing traditional approaches, but by enabling shifts from assessing products to observing learning behaviours and processes that may better prepare practitioners for the complex realities of contemporary healthcare.</p><h2 id="theoretical-foundations" tabindex="-1">Theoretical foundations <a class="header-anchor" href="#theoretical-foundations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Theoretical foundations&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>This approach to integrating AI in health professions education draws on four complementary theoretical perspectives. Each addresses a different dimension of learning and, taken together, provide a robust foundation for reimagining health professions education.</p><h3 id="social-constructivism-in-health-professions-education" tabindex="-1">Social constructivism in health professions education <a class="header-anchor" href="#social-constructivism-in-health-professions-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Social constructivism in health professions education&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Social constructivism is the lens I have chosen to explore the <em>how</em> of learning. It represents a fundamental shift away from the notion that knowledge exists independently of the knower. Rather than viewing knowledge as objective &quot;truth&quot; that can be transferred from teacher to student, social constructivism posits that knowledge is actively constructed through social interaction and is personally meaningful to the learner. In health professions education, this perspective challenges the dominant paradigm of content delivery and procedural training that has characterised much of our educational practice.</p><p>The foundational work of Vygotsky established that learning is inherently social, occurring first between people before being internalised by the individual. This interpsychological to intrapsychological progression emphasises that meaning-making is not an isolated cognitive activity but a socially mediated process involving dialogue with others. For health professionals, whose work is fundamentally relational, this understanding of knowledge construction aligns well with the realities of practice. A clinician doesn&#39;t simply apply theoretical knowledge about biomechanics and pathology to a patient; rather, they construct new understandings through interaction with each unique individual.</p><p>The zone of proximal developmentâ€”another key Vygotskian conceptâ€”describes the space between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance from a more knowledgeable other. This concept has important implications for clinical education. The traditional apprenticeship model, where students work alongside experienced clinicians, can be understood as learning within this zone. The expert clinician provides scaffolding that gradually fades as the student develops competence, engaging in a form of augmented dialogue that supports knowledge construction.</p><p>Communities of practice, as conceptualised by Lave and Wenger, extend social constructivist thinking by emphasising learning as a process of identity formation through participation in professional communities. Health professions students don&#39;t simply acquire knowledge and skills; they gradually become members of their respective professional communities through legitimate peripheral participation. The community itselfâ€”with its shared language, values, tacit knowledge, and practicesâ€”becomes the context within which individual learning occurs.</p><p>The implications for AI integration are significant. If knowledge is constructed through social processes rather than transmitted through content delivery, we should consider how AI might serve as a dialogical partner rather than merely a generator of content. We might ask how AI could support the social processes of meaning-making that are central to effective learning.</p><h3 id="critical-pedagogy-and-liberatory-education" tabindex="-1">Critical pedagogy and liberatory education <a class="header-anchor" href="#critical-pedagogy-and-liberatory-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Critical pedagogy and liberatory education&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>Paulo Freire&#39;s critical pedagogy provides a theoretical frame to explore the <em>why</em> of learning; it aims to be a response to the question, what is learning for? Critical pedagogy emerged from a critique of what Freire called the &quot;banking model&quot; of educationâ€”a model that remains pervasive in health professions education. In this model, educators &quot;deposit&quot; knowledge into passive students, who are expected to receive, memorise, and repeat this information. This approach not only fails to develop critical thinking but actively reinforces existing power hierarchies and social inequalities. In HPE, the banking model manifests in curriculum designs that prioritise standardised content delivery over student agency, reinforcing the authority of educators and institutions while positioning students as passive recipients of established knowledge.</p><p>Critical pedagogy offers an alternative vision centred on conscientizationâ€”the development of critical consciousness through which learners come to recognise systems of oppression and their own capacity to transform these systems. For health professions students, conscientization might involve recognising how education systems perpetuate inequities, how professional hierarchies limit collaborative practice, or how institutional structures themselves constrain learning. This awareness forms the foundation for transformative action, both in educational settings and in subsequent professional practice.</p><p>Dialogue stands at the heart of Freire&#39;s approach to liberation. Unlike the one-way transmission of information in banking education, dialogue involves a genuine exchange where both are simultaneously teaching and learning. True dialogue requires humility, faith in humanity, and a sense of hopeâ€”qualities that are essential not only in education but in healthcare practice itself. Through dialogue, students develop not just knowledge but the capacity to engage critically with that knowledge and to apply it in transforming their world.</p><p>The implications for AI integration extend beyond just having AI produce outputs that students passively and uncritically consume. The presence of AI tools raises questions about authority and power in educational settings: Who determines what constitutes valid knowledge? How might AI reinforce or challenge existing hierarchies? Critical pedagogy encourages us to design interactions with AI that develop critical consciousness rather than uncritical acceptance, fostering an awareness that allows students to critically evaluate both AI-generated content and the systems within which it operates.</p><h3 id="complexity-theory-and-healthcare-systems" tabindex="-1">Complexity theory and healthcare systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#complexity-theory-and-healthcare-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Complexity theory and healthcare systems&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>I have chosen to explore the <em>where</em> of learning - in healthcare and education systems - through the lens of complexity theory. The disjunction between how we educate health professionals and how healthcare actually works reflects a fundamental misalignment. Health professions education has traditionally been structured around linear, reductionist models of learning and practiceâ€”modular curricula, sequential skill development, standardised procedures, and predictable outcomes. This approach reflects a mechanistic worldview where healthcare is understood as a series of discrete problems with standardised solutions.</p><p>In contrast, contemporary healthcare operates as a complex adaptive system characterised by nonlinearity, emergence, self-organisation, and unpredictability. Complexity theory offers a framework for understanding these systems and their implications for education. Unlike complicated systems, which can be fully understood through analysis of their component parts, complex systems exhibit properties that emerge from interactions between components and cannot be reduced to or predicted from these components. Healthcare systems demonstrate this complexity in numerous ways: the unpredictable interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors in health outcomes; the ripple effects of interventions across interconnected systems; and the way small changes in initial conditions can lead to dramatically different results.</p><p>The educational implications are significant. Traditional approaches that emphasise memorisation of procedures, discrete skill development, and hierarchical knowledge structures inadequately prepare practitioners for complex environments. Instead, complexity theory suggests educational approaches that develop adaptive expertiseâ€”the ability to apply knowledge flexibly in novel situations, to recognise patterns across seemingly disparate contexts, and to navigate uncertainty with confidence. These capabilities are essential in healthcare environments where practitioners must constantly adapt their knowledge to unique patient presentations and evolving system conditions.</p><p>Current educational structures often struggle to develop these capabilities because they themselves are designed as complicated rather than complex systemsâ€”highly structured, tightly controlled, and resistant to emergence. They privilege stability over adaptation, certainty over exploration, and standardisation over diversityâ€”precisely the opposite of what complexity theory suggests is needed for learning to function in complex environments.</p><p>AI systems, properly designed, might help bridge this gap by creating dynamic, responsive learning experiences that mirror the complexity of actual practice settings. Rather than focus on AI&#39;s ability to deliver content more efficiently, we might consider how it can help make visible the complex, interconnected nature of healthcare systems and support the development of adaptive responses to unpredictable situations.</p><h3 id="connectivism-and-networked-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Connectivism and networked knowledge <a class="header-anchor" href="#connectivism-and-networked-knowledge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Connectivism and networked knowledge&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>To explore the <em>what</em> of learning, I decided to use connectivism (developed by George Siemens and Stephen Downes), a learning theory developed specifically for the digital age. It acknowledges that knowledge no longer resides primarily in individuals or static repositories but is distributed across networks of connections. Learning, in this view, involves creating and navigating these networks rather than merely acquiring content. This perspective challenges conventional notions of curriculum as a predetermined body of knowledge to be transferred to students, suggesting instead that learning involves developing the capacity to access, evaluate, and synthesise information across distributed networks.</p><p>Connectivism&#39;s emphasis on networks rather than artifacts also aligns well with the realities of modern healthcare practice. Practitioners cannot possibly memorise the rapidly expanding body of clinical knowledge; instead, they must access relevant information when needed, evaluate its credibility, and integrate it with existing knowledge, all while adapting to different contexts. This networked approach to knowledge becomes increasingly important as healthcare specialisation deepens, requiring practitioners to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and connect with diverse knowledge sources.</p><p>From a connectivist perspective, the <em>what</em> that students should learn shifts from static content to the connections between areas of knowledge, the patterns that link seemingly disparate domains, and the meta-learning skills that enable effective navigation of knowledge networks. These connections and patterns exist in the &quot;in-between spaces&quot; that traditional curricula often overlookâ€”the relationships between disciplines, the analogies between different contexts, and the emergent insights that arise from diverse knowledge combinations.</p><p>In an AI-enabled learning environment, connectivism takes on new dimensions. AI systems can help make visible the connections between knowledge domains that might otherwise remain obscure, suggest novel patterns that human cognition might miss, and personalise learning networks based on individual interests and needs. They can facilitate access to distributed knowledge sources, help learners evaluate information quality, and support the synthesis of diverse perspectives. In this way, AI becomes not merely a content creation mechanism but an active participant in the construction and navigation of knowledge networks.</p><p>This networked approach to curriculum design also challenges traditional notions of educational control, suggesting that learning pathways should be adaptable, emergent, and co-created rather than predetermined and standardised. It positions educators not as content experts but as network architects who design environments that facilitate connection, discovery, and integration across knowledge domains.</p><p>The integration of connectivism into our framework acknowledges that knowledge no longer resides solely within individuals or institutions but is distributed across networks and connections. In an era where information proliferates faster than any individual can process it, the ability to navigate knowledge networks becomes as important as the knowledge itself. Students and educators can use AI tools to dynamically generate, filter, and connect knowledge in ways that were previously impossible. This raises profound questions about what health professionals need to know versus what they need to know how to accessâ€”questions that our educational systems have yet to adequately address.</p><h3 id="integration-and-implications-for-ai-supported-learning" tabindex="-1">Integration and implications for AI-supported learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-and-implications-for-ai-supported-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Integration and implications for AI-supported learning&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>These four theoretical perspectivesâ€”social constructivism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, and connectivismâ€”offer complementary insights into how learning occurs, why it matters, where it happens, and what constitutes knowledge in the digital age. While each emerged independently, they share remarkable convergences: all reject simplistic transmission models of education; all emphasise the social, contextual nature of learning; all value adaptability over rigid standardisation; and all challenge traditional power structures in educational settings.</p><p>Together, they suggest that effective learning in HPE requires environments that foster social knowledge construction, develop critical consciousness, prepare students for complex adaptive systems, and support navigation of distributed knowledge networks. Traditional educational approaches have struggled to create such environments due to constraints of time, resources, and organisational structures. But AI offers potential pathways to address these constraints, not by automating, or making existing practices more efficient, but by enabling fundamentally different approaches to learning and teaching.</p><p>The framework presented in subsequent sections of the paper builds upon these theoretical foundations to articulate principles for AI-supported learning environments that align with the complex, networked, and rapidly evolving nature of healthcare practice. Rather than positioning AI as a simple solution to educational challenges, I present it as a catalyst for reimagining how learning occurs in ways that more authentically prepare health professionals for the demands of contemporary practice.</p><p>Core to the resulting framework is the recognition that students won&#39;t naturally become autodidacts when given access to AI tools. Simply providing AI chatbots can actually undermine education by creating an illusion of learning while merely providing answers. The principles that emerge in this paper provide a framework to help educators create learning environments supporting students to learn how to learn with AI, focusing on changes in learning behaviours rather than changes in outputs.</p><h2 id="methods-from-theoretical-foundation-to-design-principles" tabindex="-1">Methods: From theoretical foundation to design principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#methods-from-theoretical-foundation-to-design-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Methods: From theoretical foundation to design principles&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Moving from the four theoretical foundations to a set of principles for AI integration in HPE requires a methodological bridge that maintains theoretical integrity while enabling practical application. With this in mind I integrated the four theories through thematic synthesis, using a structured approach to identifying patterns, tensions, and complementarities. Rather than privileging a single theory or arbitrarily combining elements from different theories, thematic synthesis aims to preserve the distinct contributions of each theoretical perspective while identifying convergent themes that emerge from their intersection.</p><p>This approach is particularly appropriate when, as in our case, multiple theories offer complementary insights on a complex phenomenon without any single theory fully capturing its dimensions. The process involves systematically analysing each theory through a consistent analytical framework, identifying themes that cut across multiple theories, and synthesising these themes into coherent principles. This approach maintains theoretical rigour while developing practical guidance that reflects the composite insights of social constructivism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, and connectivism.</p><p>The unit of analysis for this synthesis is &quot;learning interactions&quot;â€”the points of engagement between learners and other elements of the educational ecosystem, including educators, peers, patients, content, and now, AI. Learning interactions represent a suitable unit of analysis because they are central to all four theoretical perspectives, albeit conceptualised differently in each. To take the example of &quot;knowledge representation&quot;, we see that social constructivism focuses on how knowledge emerges through interaction; critical pedagogy examines power dynamics within these interactions; complexity theory highlights how interactions generate knowledge through emergent processes; and connectivism emphasises that knowledge is situated across networks.</p><p>To analyse learning interactions systematically across all four theories, I used an analytical framework with the following six dimensions:</p><ol><li>Power dynamics: How authority, control, and decision-making are distributed within learning interactions. This dimension helps examine who decides what constitutes valid knowledge, who sets learning objectives, who evaluates learning outcomes, and how AI might reinforce or redistribute power within educational settings.</li><li>Knowledge representation: How knowledge is structured, presented, and engaged with during learning interactions. This dimension addresses questions about whether knowledge is presented as fixed or fluid, certain or contingent, universal or contextual, and how AI might transform these representations.</li><li>Agency: How learner and educator capacity for independent action and decision-making is supported or constrained within learning interactions. This dimension examines how educational approaches either foster or limit autonomy, self-direction, and critical engagement, and how AI might impact these dynamics.</li><li>Contextual influence: How broader social, cultural, and professional contexts shape and are shaped by learning interactions. This dimension recognises that learning does not occur in isolation but is embedded within larger systems that influence its meaning and application.</li><li>Identity formation: How learning interactions contribute to the development of professional identity and sense of self. This dimension examines the ways in which educational processes shape not only what learners know but who they become as practitioners, and how AI might influence this transformative process.</li><li>Temporality: How learning interactions unfold over time, including rhythms of engagement, development trajectories, and the relationship between immediate learning experiences and long-term professional development. This dimension addresses the dynamic, evolving nature of learning and how AI might alter these temporal patterns.</li></ol><p>These six dimensions were selected because they represent key concerns that emerge across the four theoretical foundations, though each theory emphasises them differently. I acknowledge that this framework is not exhaustiveâ€”other dimensions such as embodiment (the role of physical experience), affective elements (emotional aspects of learning), or ethical considerations could have been included. However, these six dimensions provide sufficient analytical breadth, enabling a systematic examination of how each theoretical perspective conceptualises key aspects of learning interactions, and exploring how AI might transform these interactions in ways that either align with or challenge our theoretical foundations.</p><p>This methodological approach enables us to move beyond viewing AI as merely a tool for efficient content generation, and instead considers how it might support more fundamental shifts in educational practice. It helps focus our attention on the processes of learningâ€”how students engage with knowledge, develop capabilities, and form professional identitiesâ€”rather than simply on the products or outputs they create. As we shift from assessing the products of learning to observing the process of learning, we create opportunities for AI to support rather than replace the deeply human aspects of HPE.</p><h3 id="examining-learning-interactions-through-multiple-theoretical-lenses" tabindex="-1">Examining learning interactions through multiple theoretical lenses <a class="header-anchor" href="#examining-learning-interactions-through-multiple-theoretical-lenses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Examining learning interactions through multiple theoretical lenses&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>To develop principles for AI integration in HPE that are theoretically sound, I conducted a systematic analysis of how each of the four theoretical foundations conceptualises learning interactions across the six dimensions identified in our analytical framework. This process involved three distinct phases:</p><ol><li>An examination of each theory, extracting its core propositions about learning interactions and mapping these against the six analytical dimensions. I focused specifically on how the theories conceptualised power dynamics, knowledge representation, agency, contextual influence, identity formation, and temporality within learning processes.</li><li>Comparative analysis to identify patterns, convergences, and tensions across the four theoretical perspectives. This involved creating a matrix where each cell represented the intersection of a particular theory and dimension, visualising similarities and differences in how each theory addressed each dimension.</li><li>Synthesise cross-cutting themes, focusing on insights that appeared across multiple theoretical perspectives and had particular relevance for AI integration in HPE. These themes formed the foundation for the principles.</li></ol><h3 id="individual-theory-analysis" tabindex="-1">Individual theory analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#individual-theory-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Individual theory analysis&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><h4 id="social-constructivism" tabindex="-1">Social constructivism <a class="header-anchor" href="#social-constructivism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Social constructivism&quot;">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Power dynamics</strong>: Social constructivism acknowledges asymmetrical power dynamics between experts and novices but emphasises the importance of gradually shifting authority toward learners through fading scaffolding. The &quot;more knowledgeable other&quot; initially holds greater power in determining learning activities and evaluating performance, but effective learning environments progressively transfer control to learners as their capabilities develop.</p><p><strong>Knowledge representation</strong>: Knowledge is represented not as fixed content to be transmitted but as personally meaningful constructions developed through social interaction. Knowledge is contextualised, provisional, and constantly evolving through collaborative meaning-making. The emphasis is on deep conceptual understanding rather than superficial reproductive knowledge.</p><p><strong>Agency</strong>: Learners are positioned as active constructors of knowledge rather than passive recipients. Agency is developed through opportunities to test ideas, receive feedback, and refine understanding. The theory emphasizes that effective learning environments support autonomous exploration within scaffolded boundaries.</p><p><strong>Contextual influence</strong>: Learning is inseparable from its social and cultural context. Communities of practice profoundly shape what counts as knowledge, how learning proceeds, and how knowledge is applied. Authentic contexts that reflect actual practice environments are essential for meaningful learning.</p><p><strong>Identity formation</strong>: Learning is fundamentally about becoming a member of a community, not just acquiring knowledge and skills. Through legitimate peripheral participation, learners gradually develop the identity of a practitioner. Knowledge construction and identity formation are inseparable processes.</p><p><strong>Temporality</strong>: Learning unfolds through developmental trajectories that involve progressive participation in increasingly complex aspects of practice. Timing of support is crucial, with scaffolding provided when needed and removed as learners develop independence. Learning is conceptualised as a long-term trajectory of participation rather than discrete episodes of knowledge acquisition.</p><h4 id="critical-pedagogy" tabindex="-1">Critical pedagogy <a class="header-anchor" href="#critical-pedagogy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Critical pedagogy&quot;">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Power dynamics</strong>: Critical pedagogy explicitly addresses power imbalances in educational settings, critiquing how traditional approaches reinforce social hierarchies and dominance behaviours. It advocates for a redistribution of power through dialogue and mutual learning, where educators and learners both teach and learn from each other.</p><p><strong>Knowledge representation</strong>: Knowledge is never neutral but always reflects particular interests and power structures. Thus all education is inherently political as well as pedagogical. .Critical pedagogy rejects the notion of objective knowledge, emphasising instead how knowledge is socially constructed and contested. It values knowledge that emerges from lived experience alongside information.</p><p><strong>Agency</strong>: Learner agency is central to critical pedagogy, which emphasises conscientizationâ€”developing awareness of social realities and capacity to transform them. Education should empower learners to become subjects who act upon the world rather than objects who are acted upon.</p><p><strong>Contextual influence</strong>: Learning cannot be separated from broader sociopolitical contexts. Critical pedagogy emphasises how educational practices either reinforce or challenge existing social arrangements. Authentic learning addresses real-world problems and contradictions within learners&#39; social contexts.</p><p><strong>Identity formation</strong>: Identity development involves recognising one&#39;s position within social systems and developing capacity to transform those systems. Critical consciousness reshapes how learners understand themselves in relation to others and to structures of power. Professional identity formation includes developing identity as an agent of social change.</p><p><strong>Temporality</strong>: Learning involves cycles of action and reflection (praxis) that unfold over time. Conscientization is not a single event but an ongoing process of developing critical awareness. The temporal horizon extends beyond immediate learning to future social transformation, positioning learning as an extended process rather than an activity with a fixed end-point.</p><h4 id="complexity-theory" tabindex="-1">Complexity theory <a class="header-anchor" href="#complexity-theory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Complexity theory&quot;">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Power dynamics</strong>: Complexity theory challenges hierarchical control structures, suggesting that learning emerges from distributed interactions rather than centralised authority. It emphasises self-organisation and questions the efficacy of rigid top-down control in complex systems.</p><p><strong>Knowledge representation</strong>: Knowledge is represented as emergent patterns of activity rather than fixed facts. These patterns cannot be reduced to component parts but arise from complex interactions. Knowledge is provisional, contextual, and constantly evolving in response to new conditions.</p><p><strong>Agency</strong>: Agency is distributed across the system rather than residing solely in individual learners or educators. Effective learning involves developing capacity to influence complex systems through adaptive responses rather than controlling them through predetermined actions.</p><p><strong>Contextual influence</strong>: Context is not just an influence on learning but constitutive of it. Small changes in initial conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. Learning is deeply embedded in interdependent systems that cannot be fully separated for analysis.</p><p><strong>Identity formation</strong>: Professional identity emerges from participation in complex adaptive systems rather than being simply transmitted or constructed. Identity formation involves developing comfort with uncertainty and capacity for adaptation in unpredictable environments.</p><p><strong>Temporality</strong>: Learning exhibits non-linear progression with periods of apparent stability punctuated by rapid change. Timing of interventions is crucial but difficult to predict. The relationship between immediate activities and long-term outcomes is complex and often unpredictable.</p><h4 id="connectivism" tabindex="-1">Connectivism <a class="header-anchor" href="#connectivism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Connectivism&quot;">â€‹</a></h4><p><strong>Power dynamics</strong>: Connectivism reimagines authority as distributed across networks rather than residing in individuals or institutions. Power lies in the ability to form, navigate, and influence connections rather than in possessing knowledge. Authority becomes more fluid and context-dependent.</p><p><strong>Knowledge representation</strong>: Knowledge exists in the connections between information sources rather than in individual minds. It is constantly evolving, distributed across networks, and accessed through connections rather than possessed. Currency and accuracy of knowledge depend on the quality of network connections.</p><p><strong>Agency</strong>: Agency involves capacity to build, navigate, and reconfigure networks. Learners must develop capacity to evaluate information quality, recognise patterns across sources, and make meaningful connections. Decision-making about what to learn becomes as important as learning itself.</p><p><strong>Contextual influence</strong>: Learning networks extend beyond formal educational contexts to include diverse information sources and communities. The quality of learning depends not just on individual effort but on the diversity and quality of network connections available.</p><p><strong>Identity formation</strong>: Professional identity develops through participation in knowledge networks that extend beyond traditional communities of practice. Identity becomes more fluid, with practitioners positioned as nodes in evolving networks rather than members of stable communities.</p><p><strong>Temporality</strong>: Learning occurs in real-time through continuous engagement with evolving knowledge networks. The half-life of knowledge has shortened dramatically, requiring ongoing connection rather than one-time acquisition. Learning cycles compress as knowledge evolves more rapidly.</p><h3 id="comparative-theory-analysis" tabindex="-1">Comparative theory analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#comparative-theory-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comparative theory analysis&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p>This matrix visualisation helps identify patterns across theories and dimensions. We see how each theory addresses similar concerns but with different emphases and conceptualisations. For example, all theories challenge traditional power dynamics but do so in different waysâ€”from social constructivism&#39;s graduated transfer of authority to connectivism&#39;s distributed network authority. In the matrix below we begin to see the emergence of colour-coded themes that will form the foundation of a set of principles to support the integration of AI into an education framework that aims to address some of the pedagogical challenges highlighted earlier.</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Analytical Dimension</th><th>Social constructivism</th><th>Critical pedagogy</th><th>Complexity theory</th><th>Connectivism</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Power dynamics</strong></td><td><span style="color:purple;">Gradual transfer of authority from expert to learner through fading scaffolding</span>;

Dialogic knowledge construction</strong> (augmented dialogue)</span>. All four theories emphasise that knowledge emerges through dialogue and interaction rather than transmission. Social constructivism highlights collaborative meaning-making; critical pedagogy centres dialogic exchange; complexity theory emphasises emergent understanding from interactions; and connectivism focuses on knowledge created through network connections. This suggests AI integration should support augmented dialogue rather than one-way information delivery.</p><p><span style="color:red;"><strong>2. Critical consciousness</strong></span>. While most explicitly articulated in critical pedagogy, elements of critical awareness appear across all theories. Social constructivism implies critical reflection on community practices; complexity theory requires critical awareness of system dynamics; and connectivism necessitates critical evaluation of information sources and network connections. This suggests AI integration should develop critical consciousness about both content and AI itself.</p><p><span style="color:blue;"><strong>3. Adaptive expertise development</strong></span>. All theories challenge fixed notions of expertise. Social constructivism emphasises adaptation through scaffolded experiences; critical pedagogy focuses on adaptability in transforming circumstances; complexity theory centres adaptive responses to unpredictable conditions; and connectivism highlights adaptation to evolving knowledge networks. This suggests AI should support development of adaptive rather than routine expertise.</p><p><span style="color:orange;"><strong>4. Dynamic contextual learning</strong></span>. All theories emphasise that learning is deeply embedded in authentic contexts. Social constructivism stresses situated learning; critical pedagogy emphasises real-world problem-solving; complexity theory highlights contextual embedded; and connectivism locates learning in diverse network contexts. This suggests AI should enhance rather than abstract from the dynamic contexts of healthcare practice.</p><p><span style="color:pink;"><strong>5. Emergent curriculum design</strong></span>. Rather than fixed curricula, all theories suggest more fluid, emergent approaches to determining what should be learned. Social constructivism emphasises negotiated learning pathways; critical pedagogy rejects predetermined content; complexity theory highlights emergent learning outcomes; and connectivism emphasises dynamic knowledge flows. This suggests AI should support more adaptive, responsive curriculum structures.</p><p><span style="color:brown;"><strong>6. Metacognitive development</strong></span>. All theories emphasise development of higher-order thinking about learning itself. Social constructivism highlights reflective practice; critical pedagogy centres critical reflection (praxis); complexity theory requires pattern recognition across systems; and connectivism emphasises meta-learning skills. This suggests AI should enhance metacognitive awareness and reflective practice.</p><p><span style="color:green;"><strong>7. Interprofessional community knowledge building</strong></span>. A theme appearing across theories is the importance of crossing traditional knowledge boundaries. Social constructivism&#39;s communities of practice can extend across professions; critical pedagogy challenges disciplinary silos as power structures; complexity theory emphasises interconnections across system components; and connectivism explicitly values diverse network connections. This suggests AI should facilitate knowledge building across traditional professional and disciplinary boundaries.</p><p>The cross-cutting themes do not map perfectly to single rows or columns - they emerge from patterns that cut across different dimensions and theories. Some cells contribute to multiple themes, and some themes draw from multiple dimensions. This reflects the complex, interconnected nature of these theoretical perspectives and the richness of insights they offer for AI integration in health professions education.</p><p>The cross-cutting themes that form the basis of our ACADEMIC framework emerge from these intersections. For instance, the theme of &quot;Dialogic Knowledge Construction&quot; emerges from how all four theories emphasise interaction and exchange in knowledge development, though they conceptualise this differently. Similarly, &quot;Interprofessional Knowledge Integration&quot; emerges from how each theory, in its own way, emphasises crossing traditional boundaries of knowledge and practice.</p><h2 id="the-academic-framework-for-ai-supported-learning-in-health-professions-education" tabindex="-1">The ACADEMIC framework for AI-supported learning in health professions education <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-academic-framework-for-ai-supported-learning-in-health-professions-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The ACADEMIC framework for AI-supported learning in health professions education&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>The theoretical analysis revealed seven cross-cutting themes that emerged from examining social constructivism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, and connectivism through the lens of learning interactions. In this section, I translate these themes into practical principles that would support a reimagining of HPE, regardless of the integration of AI. However, these principles are also well-aligned with a process for integrating AI. I should note that, while the following concepts are not new, I believe that this integrated framework to guide practice is novel. In addition, the principles I&#39;m suggesting here are not meant to be prescriptive but instead offer a theoretically-informed guide to thoughtful integration of AI across diverse educational contexts.</p><h3 id="_1-augmented-dialogue-for-knowledge-co-construction" tabindex="-1">1. <strong>A</strong>ugmented dialogue for knowledge co-construction <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-augmented-dialogue-for-knowledge-co-construction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. **A**ugmented dialogue for knowledge co-construction&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI should be considered as a (sometimes flawed) participant in dialogic learning processes rather than as an authoritative source of knowledge. Learning environments should position AI as a thinking partner that contributes to knowledge construction without dominating the dialogue, while preserving the essential human relationships that foster meaningful learning.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the cross-cutting theme of dialogic knowledge construction, drawing particularly on social constructivism&#39;s emphasis on collaborative meaning-making and critical pedagogy&#39;s focus on dialogue as a path to liberation.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle directly challenges content-focused educational models that overwhelm students with information but provide insufficient opportunities for meaning-making. By positioning AI as a conversational partner rather than a content generating mechanism, we shift emphasis from information transmission to knowledge construction.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> In practice, this might involve the use of AI to generate provocative questions rather than definitive answers, to represent multiple perspectives on complex issues, or to suggest connections between ideas that emerge during group discussions. The key is that AI augments rather than replaces the social processes through which knowledge is constructed. For example, in case-based learning, AI might offer alternative interpretations of clinical data or suggest diagnostic possibilities that students had not considered, serving as an additional &quot;voice&quot; in the conversation without providing definitive conclusions.</p><h3 id="_2-critical-consciousness-and-power" tabindex="-1">2. <strong>C</strong>ritical consciousness and power <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-critical-consciousness-and-power" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. **C**ritical consciousness and power&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI implementation should support the development of critical consciousness while making transparent the limitations, biases, and assumptions embedded in AI systems. Learning activities should position students as critical evaluators of AI outputs rather than passive consumers of generated information, fostering awareness of how AI systems reflect and potentially reinforce existing power structures.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the theme of critical consciousness, drawing particularly on critical pedagogy&#39;s emphasis on power dynamics and connectivism&#39;s model of distributed authority and expertise.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle aims to challenge the persistent power dynamics in HPE that position students as passive recipients of information rather than active co-creators of personally meaningful knowledge. It also acknowledges the risk that uncritical AI implementation could reinforce these dynamics by presenting AI as an unquestionable authority when in fact it should also be subject to critical evaluation (as should all stakeholders in the learning ecosystem).</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve designing activities where students actively evaluate AI-generated content, exploring the socio-political contexts that generated their training data, compare AI outputs with diverse human perspectives, or examine the limitations of AI in addressing complex ethical dilemmas. For example, in medical education, students might analyse how an AI diagnostic system reaches different conclusions than experienced clinicians, exploring the biases in training data, resultant reasoning processes, embedded values, and contextual factors that influence both human and AI decision-making.</p><h3 id="_3-adaptive-expertise-development" tabindex="-1">3. <strong>A</strong>daptive expertise development <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-adaptive-expertise-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. **A**daptive expertise development&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI integration should prioritise the development of adaptive expertiseâ€”the ability to apply knowledge flexibly in novel situationsâ€”over the efficient delivery of information. Learning environments should use AI to create varied, challenging scenarios that develop capacity for knowledge adaptation rather than knowledge reproduction.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the theme of adaptive expertise development, drawing particularly on complexity theory&#39;s emphasis on adaptation in unpredictable environments and connectivism&#39;s focus on navigating evolving knowledge networks.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle addresses the misalignment between structured and reductive educational systems and the complex, uncertain reality of healthcare practice. Rather than attempting to prepare students for every possible situation they might encounter (an impossible task), this principle focuses on developing their capacity to adapt knowledge to novel situations.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve using AI to generate diverse clinical scenarios that require transfer of knowledge across contexts, to introduce unexpected complications that challenge routine application of procedures, or to simulate unusual presentations that test the boundaries of students&#39; understanding. For example, in clinical reasoning development, AI could generate adaptive case sequences that respond to a student&#39;s developing mastery by introducing appropriate complications or variations, helping students develop flexible rather than rigid application of clinical principles.</p><h3 id="_4-dynamic-contexts-for-situated-learning" tabindex="-1">4. <strong>D</strong>ynamic contexts for situated learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-dynamic-contexts-for-situated-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. **D**ynamic contexts for situated learning&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI should be used to enhance rather than detract from the authentic contexts in which healthcare professionals practice. Learning experiences should incorporate the social, cultural, and systemic factors that shape real-world practice, rather than reducing healthcare to technical procedures or discrete knowledge components.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the theme of dynamic contextual learning, drawing particularly on social constructivism&#39;s emphasis on situated learning and complexity theory&#39;s recognition of contextual embeddedness.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle addresses the decontextualisation of knowledge that occurs in many health professions curricula, where students learn concepts and procedures without sufficient understanding of how they apply in complex, messy practice environments. It recognises that the gap between education and practice stems partly from oversimplified and reductive learning contexts that fail to capture the complexity of clinical practice.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve using AI to create rich simulated environments that incorporate social determinants of health, resource constraints, team dynamics, and patient perspectivesâ€”factors often stripped away in simplified educational scenarios. For example, in nursing education, AI could generate patient scenarios that include realistic social circumstances, communication challenges, and resource limitations, requiring students to navigate not just technical procedures but the complex human and system factors that influence care delivery.</p><h3 id="_5-emergent-curriculum-design" tabindex="-1">5. <strong>E</strong>mergent curriculum design <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-emergent-curriculum-design" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;5. **E**mergent curriculum design&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI integration should support more emergent, adaptive approaches to curriculum design and implementation. Rather than rigidly predetermined pathways, learning experiences should maintain core structure while allowing for adaptation based on evolving healthcare needs, emerging knowledge, and individual learning trajectories.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the themes of knowledge as dynamic and contextual and non-linear, network-informed learning trajectories, drawing particularly on complexity theory&#39;s emphasis on emergence and connectivism&#39;s adaptive approach to curriculum development.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle addresses the rigidity of traditional curriculum structures that struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving healthcare knowledge and practices. It recognises that predefined content quickly becomes outdated and that effective preparation for practice requires more adaptive approaches to determining what students should learn.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve using AI to identify emerging healthcare trends that should inform curriculum evolution, to suggest personalised learning pathways based on student interests and needs, or to curate current research findings that have implications for clinical practice. For example, in medical education, AI could analyse emerging patterns in healthcare delivery or research literature to suggest &quot;just-in-time&quot; curriculum modules that address evolving practice needs, ensuring that learning remains relevant to current healthcare realities.</p><h3 id="_6-metacognitive-development" tabindex="-1">6. <strong>M</strong>etacognitive development <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-metacognitive-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6. **M**etacognitive development&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI integration should prioritise the development of metacognitive capabilitiesâ€”the ability to monitor and regulate one&#39;s own thinking processes. Learning environments should use AI to make thinking processes visible, to prompt meaningful reflection, and to help students develop awareness of their own cognitive patterns and biases.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the theme of metacognitive development, drawing particularly on social constructivism&#39;s emphasis on self-regulation and critical pedagogy&#39;s focus on reflection.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle addresses the challenge that health professionals must not only possess knowledge but know how to apply it appropriately in complex situations. It recognises that metacognitive capabilitiesâ€”knowing when and how to use certain kinds of knowledgeâ€”are often underdeveloped in traditional educational approaches that emphasise content acquisition over reflective practice.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve students using AI to analyse patterns in their clinical reasoning over time, to provide personalised prompts for reflection on these patterns, or to make visible the thinking processes behind expert decision-making. For example, in occupational therapy education, AI might track a student&#39;s evolving diagnostic reasoning across multiple cases, helping them identify when they tend to fixate on particular explanations or overlook certain factors, thereby developing greater awareness of their own thinking patterns.</p><h3 id="_7-interprofessional-communities-of-learning" tabindex="-1">7. <strong>I</strong>nterprofessional <strong>C</strong>ommunities of learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-interprofessional-communities-of-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;7. **I**nterprofessional **C**ommunities of learning&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><p><strong>The principle:</strong> AI implementation should facilitate knowledge building across traditional boundariesâ€”disciplinary, institutional, and geographical. Learning environments should use AI to connect diverse perspectives, translate across disciplinary languages, and create opportunities for collaborative knowledge creation that transcend conventional educational silos.</p><p><strong>Theoretical foundation:</strong> This principle emerges from the theme of interprofessional knowledge integration, drawing particularly on connectivism&#39;s emphasis on networked knowledge and social constructivism&#39;s communities of practice.</p><p><strong>Addressing challenges:</strong> This principle addresses the fragmentation of HPE into discrete disciplines and subjects, which poorly prepares students for the collaborative, boundary-spanning work of contemporary healthcare. It recognises that effective practice requires integration of diverse knowledge domains that are often taught separately.</p><p><strong>Implementation implications:</strong> This might involve using AI to identify connections between seemingly disparate areas of knowledge, to facilitate interprofessional learning experiences, or to translate between the disciplinary languages of different health professions. For example, in interprofessional education, AI could analyse contributions from students across different health disciplines, highlight complementary perspectives, and suggest integrative approaches that combine insights from multiple professional viewpoints.</p><h2 id="summary-of-the-academic-framework" tabindex="-1">Summary of the ACADEMIC framework <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-of-the-academic-framework" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary of the ACADEMIC framework&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Principle</th><th>Theoretical foundation</th><th>Core concept</th><th>Addresses HPE challenge</th><th>Implementation example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>A</strong>ugmented dialogue for knowledge co-construction</td><td>Dialogic knowledge construction; social constructivism and critical pedagogy</td><td>AI as a participant in dialogic learning processes rather than authoritative source</td><td>Content overload with insufficient meaning-making opportunities</td><td>AI generates provocative questions and alternative perspectives during case discussions rather than providing definitive answers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>C</strong>ritical consciousness</td><td>Critical consciousness; critical pedagogy and connectivism</td><td>Students as critical evaluators of AI outputs and the power dynamics embedded in AI systems</td><td>Power dynamics that position students as passive recipients of knowledge</td><td>Students analyze differences between AI and human clinical reasoning, examining values and contextual factors influencing both</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A</strong>daptive expertise development</td><td>Adaptive expertise development; complexity theory and connectivism</td><td>Prioritize developing flexible knowledge application in novel situations over content delivery</td><td>Misalignment between structured education and complex healthcare practice</td><td>AI generates diverse clinical scenarios requiring knowledge transfer across contexts and adaptation to unexpected complications</td></tr><tr><td><strong>D</strong>ynamic contexts for situated learning</td><td>Dynamic contextual learning; social constructivism and complexity theory</td><td>Enhance rather than abstract from the authentic contexts of healthcare practice</td><td>Decontextualized knowledge that fails to prepare for real-world practice</td><td>AI creates simulations incorporating social determinants, resource constraints, team dynamics, and patient perspectives</td></tr><tr><td><strong>E</strong>mergent curriculum design</td><td>Knowledge as dynamic and contextual; complexity theory and connectivism</td><td>Support adaptive approaches to curriculum that respond to evolving healthcare needs</td><td>Rigid curriculum structures that struggle to keep pace with evolving knowledge</td><td>AI analyzes healthcare trends and research to suggest &quot;just-in-time&quot; curriculum modules addressing current practice needs</td></tr><tr><td><strong>M</strong>etacognitive development</td><td>Metacognitive development; social constructivism and critical pedagogy</td><td>Make thinking processes visible and develop awareness of cognitive patterns and biases</td><td>Underdevelopment of metacognitive capabilities needed for complex practice</td><td>AI tracks patterns in clinical reasoning across cases, helping students identify their cognitive tendencies and biases</td></tr><tr><td><strong>I</strong>nterprofessional Community knowledge building</td><td>Interprofessional knowledge integration; connectivism and social constructivism</td><td>Facilitate knowledge building across disciplinary, institutional, and geographical boundaries</td><td>Fragmentation of education into silos that poorly prepare for collaborative practice</td><td>AI identifies connections between disciplines, translates between professional languages, and highlights complementary perspectives</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="integration-and-implementation-considerations" tabindex="-1">Integration and implementation considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-and-implementation-considerations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Integration and implementation considerations&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>These seven principles provide a theoretically grounded framework for AI integration in HPE. They are complementary rather than mutually exclusive, and effective implementation will likely involve addressing multiple principles simultaneously. Together, they offer a vision of AI-supported learning that enhances rather than diminishes the human aspects of learning while addressing longstanding challenges in how we prepare clinical practitioners for complex healthcare environments.</p><p>Implementation of these principles must be contextually responsive rather than prescriptive. Different educational settings will have different priorities, constraints, and capabilities that influence how these principles translate into practice. Moreover, implementation should be approached as an iterative process of design, evaluation, and refinement, with ongoing attention to both intended and unintended consequences of AI integration.</p><p>Uniting these principles is their grounding in robust theoretical perspectives on how learning occurs, why it matters, where it happens, and what constitutes knowledge in the digital age. Rather than starting with technology capabilities and asking how they might be applied in HPE, this article began with fundamental questions about the nature of learning and considers how AI might support more effective approaches to these pedagogical processes.</p><p>The principles presented here acknowledge both the potential and the limitations of AI in educational contexts. They position AI not as a replacement for human teachers or human relationships, but as a potential partner that students must learn to communicate with effectively. When thoughtfully integrated, AI may help address persistent challenges in how we prepare health professionals for the complex, uncertain, and rapidly evolving healthcare landscape they will navigate throughout their careers.</p><p>The framework shifts our focus from assessing products to an observation of learning behaviours and processes, recognising that the value of AI in HPE lies not in helping students produce better outputs but in supporting meaningful changes in learning behaviour. This framing recognises that most students are not natural autodidacts and therefore need guidance in how to learn with AI as a partner rather than a tool for cognitive offloading.</p><p>In the second paper of this series, I will explore considerations around the practical implementation of the ACADEMIC framework, providing concrete examples and strategies for educators seeking to incorporate these principles into learning communities in HPE contexts.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Health professions education faces a fundamental challenge: graduates are simultaneously overwhelmed with information yet simultaneously under-prepared for complex practice. The rapid student adoption of AI tools reveals gaps in our educational approaches that many institutions are responding to with attempts to exert their power and implement measures of control, rather than transformative integration.</p><p>This article presents the ACADEMIC framework for AI integration in HPE. An analysis of social constructivism, critical pedagogy, complexity theory, and connectivism through the lens of learning interactions, identified seven principles to guide AI implementation. These principles help all stakeholders in a learning ecosystem to shift focus from AI as content generator to AI as a learning partner, providing a theoretically grounded middle path between viewing AI as either threat or panacea, and addressing the misalignment between education and practice through adaptive approaches.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly, it recognises that students need guidance in learning with AI, focusing on processes rather than the all-to-easy mechanism of using AI to create better outputs. This repositions AI not as a replacement for human educators but as a catalyst for addressing persistent challenges in preparing health professionals for contemporary healthcare environments.</p></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-39a288b8 data-v-e257564d><!--[--><!--]--><!----><nav class="prev-next" aria-labelledby="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d><span class="visually-hidden" id="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d>Pager</span><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><!----></div><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><a class="VPLink link pager-link next" href="/" data-v-e257564d><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-e257564d>Next page</span><span class="title" data-v-e257564d>Why this?</span><!--]--></a></div></nav></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
