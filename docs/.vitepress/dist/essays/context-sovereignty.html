prompting strategies, overlooking more fundamental questions about the nature of context in human-AI collaboration. This paper introduces the concept of context sovereignty as a framework for reimagining personalised learning and cognitive partnership between humans and artificial intelligence. Drawing from complexity science and learning theory, I argue that context functions as a dynamic field of meaning-making rather than static background information. Current approaches to AI-supported learning—primarily prompting and document uploading—create episodic burdens that position learners as adapting to AI systems rather than AI systems adapting to human cognition. Context sovereignty offers an alternative paradigm based on three principles: persistent understanding, individual agency, and cognitive extension. This framework addresses concerns about privacy, intellectual challenge, and authentic assessment whilst enabling new forms of collaborative learning that preserve human agency. Rather than treating AI as an external tool requiring skillful manipulation, context sovereignty suggests AI can become a cognitive partner that understands and extends human thinking whilst respecting individual boundaries. The implications extend beyond technical implementation to fundamental questions about the nature of learning, assessment, and human-AI collaboration in educational settings.</p><h2 id="key-takeaways" tabindex="-1">Key takeaways <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-takeaways" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key takeaways&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Context is dynamic and relational</strong>: Rather than static information to be uploaded, context functions as a complex adaptive system characterised by emergence, temporal evolution, and relational dynamics that continuously shape meaning-making processes.</li><li><strong>Current approaches create cognitive burdens</strong>: Episodic prompting and document uploading require constant re-contextualisation, creating cognitive overhead whilst establishing power asymmetries where learners adapt to AI systems rather than vice versa.</li><li><strong>Three principles enable cognitive partnership</strong>: Persistent understanding, individual agency, and cognitive extension work together to create conditions for genuine collaboration where AI systems adapt to human cognitive patterns whilst preserving individual control over personal context.</li><li><strong>Collaborative learning preserves individual autonomy</strong>: Distributed contextual awareness enables learning communities where multiple AI systems coordinate whilst maintaining clear boundaries about context sharing and individual control.</li><li><strong>Assessment should focus on collaborative problem-solving</strong>: Rather than attempting to distinguish between human and AI contributions, educational evaluation should examine learners&#39; capacity to mobilise contextual knowledge through AI partnership to address meaningful challenges.</li><li><strong>Privacy and functionality can coexist</strong>: By separating intelligence services from personal data storage, learners can access sophisticated AI capabilities whilst maintaining complete control over their personal information and meaning-making processes.</li><li><strong>Implementation requires cultural transformation</strong>: Realising context sovereignty&#39;s potential demands not just technical capability but fundamental shifts in educational practices, institutional frameworks, and cultural understanding of human-AI collaboration.</li></ul><h2 id="introduction-beyond-prompting" tabindex="-1">Introduction: Beyond prompting <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction-beyond-prompting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction: Beyond prompting&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The current discourse around artificial intelligence in education has become preoccupied with prompting strategies, overlooking fundamental questions about the nature of context in human-AI collaboration. I propose that prompting represents merely one component of a broader capability: context setting, which requires understanding context as a dynamic, relational field rather than static information. This paper introduces <strong>context sovereignty</strong> as a way to better understand AI-supported personalised learning and cognitive partnership between humans and artificial intelligence. Drawing from complexity science and learning theory, I argue that current approaches—episodic prompting and document uploading—misunderstand the temporal, relational nature of context and create cognitive burdens that position learners as adapting to AI systems rather than vice versa.</p><p>Context sovereignty offers a different paradigm based on three principles: <em>persistent understanding</em>, <em>individual agency</em>, and <em>cognitive extension</em>. This framework envisions accumulating relationships between human and artificial intelligence that preserve autonomy whilst enabling sophisticated cognitive partnership. The approach addresses concerns about echo chambers, authentic assessment, and human agency by demonstrating how deep contextual understanding enables more sophisticated intellectual challenge, collaborative problem-solving, and preservation of human authorship over learning processes.</p><h2 id="the-nature-of-context-and-its-significance-for-learning" tabindex="-1">The nature of context and its significance for learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-nature-of-context-and-its-significance-for-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The nature of context and its significance for learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Context is not background information but the active, dynamic field within which meaning emerges and understanding develops. Drawing from complexity science, context functions as &quot;a space of dynamic exchanges between components&quot; rather than a static backdrop (Capra &amp; Luisi, 2014; Davis &amp; Sumara, 2006). Context shapes not only what we understand, but how we understand, creating conditions within which knowledge becomes personally meaningful and intellectually productive. This ecological understanding aligns with complexity theory&#39;s emphasis on emergence and non-linear dynamics in learning systems. Context operates as a &quot;complex adaptive system,&quot; where small changes can lead to significant transformations in understanding (Holland, 2006). Personal context encompasses prior experiences, cultural frameworks, emotional associations, and conceptual structures that learners bring to any encounter. This context is irreducibly individual whilst existing in dynamic relationship with broader social, cultural, and institutional contexts.</p><p>Context&#39;s significance for learning extends beyond personalisation to fundamental processes of knowledge construction. Learning involves integration of new understanding with existing cognitive structures through assimilation and accommodation (Piaget, 1977). The quality of this integration depends on contextual connections learners can make between new knowledge and existing understanding. Context provides the relational substrate within which connections form, determining their durability and transferability, creating &quot;conditionalized knowledge&quot; that is connected to appropriate application conditions (Bransford et al., 2000). Context serves as the foundation for transfer—applying knowledge across different situations (Barnett &amp; Ceci, 2002). Without rich contextual understanding, knowledge remains inert, bound to acquisition circumstances. Deep contextual awareness enables recognition of patterns transcending particular domains, supporting &quot;far transfer&quot;—flexible application across significantly different contexts (Salomon &amp; Perkins, 1989). This capacity emerges not from decontextualised principles but from understanding how contextual elements interact to create application conditions.</p><p>Context&#39;s temporal dimension adds complexity challenging traditional educational approaches. Context continuously evolves through accumulated experiences, expertise development, and changing circumstances. What constitutes relevant context for a first-year student differs fundamentally from a senior professional, not merely in content but in contextual knowledge structure and organisation. This evolution suggests learning systems must adapt to these changes, growing sophisticated as learners&#39; contextual landscapes develop.</p><h2 id="current-approaches-to-context-in-ai-supported-learning" tabindex="-1">Current approaches to context in AI-supported learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#current-approaches-to-context-in-ai-supported-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Current approaches to context in AI-supported learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Contemporary AI engagement in education relies primarily on prompting strategies and retrieval-augmented generation through document uploading. Both approaches treat context as additive rather than foundational, reducing context to static information whilst missing its relational and processual qualities. Prompting strategies require learners to provide explicit contextual information within requests—background knowledge, learning objectives, preferred explanations, and circumstances. This places entire contextualisation burden on learners, requiring fresh articulation with each interaction. The cognitive overhead diverts mental resources from learning toward orienting the AI system, creating &quot;episodic burden&quot;—the load of repeatedly establishing rather than building upon accumulated understanding. This contradicts context&#39;s temporal and evolutionary nature, treating as static what is actually dynamic and developing.</p><p>Document uploading and retrieval-augmented generation confuse information with context. Uploading documents provides content anyone could share but fails to capture the personal lens through which information becomes meaningful to individual learners. The distinction between &quot;information context&quot; and &quot;personal context&quot; proves crucial—whilst the former can be shared through upload, the latter requires understanding how information connects to existing knowledge, goals, values, and thinking patterns. This reflects mechanistic rather than ecological understanding, treating context as document collections rather than active cognitive environments where meaning emerges.</p><p>These approaches create interconnected limitations undermining meaningful human-AI collaboration. They establish asymmetrical power relationships where learners surrender personal information to access AI capabilities, creating &quot;cognitive colonisation&quot; where commercial entities accumulate value from user data whilst users lack visibility into information processing. The resulting dynamics position learners as adapting to AI systems rather than AI systems adapting to learners&#39; established thinking and learning patterns. Most fundamentally, these episodic approaches treat context as interaction addendum rather than genuine cognitive partnership foundation. They create fragmented rather than coherent learning experiences, missing opportunities to develop persistent, accumulating understanding that could transform human-AI collaboration in learning. By failing to recognise context as a complex adaptive system evolving through engagement, current approaches cannot support sophisticated personalised challenge, collaborative learning, and cognitive extension possible when context is properly understood and preserved within human control.</p><h2 id="toward-context-sovereignty-a-different-approach" tabindex="-1">Toward context sovereignty: A different approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#toward-context-sovereignty-a-different-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Toward context sovereignty: A different approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Context sovereignty offers a fundamentally different approach to human-AI collaboration in learning, positioning learners&#39; personal context—their knowledge, values, goals, and thinking patterns—as the central element around which AI interaction is organised. Unlike current approaches requiring learners to adapt to AI systems, context sovereignty enables AI systems to adapt to learners&#39; established cognitive patterns whilst maintaining complete individual control over personal information. Context sovereignty can be distinguished from data sovereignty by its emphasis on meaning rather than information. Whilst data sovereignty focuses on who controls raw information, context sovereignty emphasises personal significance, cognitive relationships, and individual knowledge relevance. It recognises context not as data to be stored and retrieved, but as the active cognitive environment within which learning and understanding develop.</p><p>The concept encompasses three fundamental principles creating conditions for genuine cognitive partnership. <strong>Persistent understanding</strong> enables AI systems to develop accumulating comprehension of learners over time, reducing cognitive burden of repeated contextualisation whilst maintaining clear boundaries about context sharing and usage. <strong>Individual agency</strong> ensures learners maintain complete control over personal context, choosing what to share, when to share it, and how it influences AI interactions, including rights to update, modify, or withdraw contextual information without compromising AI capability access. <strong>Cognitive extension</strong> positions AI systems as amplifiers of human reasoning rather than substitutes, extending learners&#39; cognitive capabilities by understanding existing mental models deeply enough to offer both support and sophisticated challenge. This approach transforms AI from a generic tool providing identical capabilities to everyone into a personalised cognitive partner adapting to individual learning patterns and intellectual development.</p><h2 id="a-conceptual-framework-for-context-sovereignty-in-learning" tabindex="-1">A conceptual framework for context sovereignty in learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-conceptual-framework-for-context-sovereignty-in-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A conceptual framework for context sovereignty in learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Context sovereignty operates through three fundamental principles creating conditions for genuine cognitive partnership between human and artificial intelligence, reflecting the ecological and temporal understanding of context whilst preserving human agency in meaning-making processes.</p><p><strong>Persistent understanding</strong> enables AI systems to develop accumulating comprehension of learners over time, acknowledging that context continuously evolves through engagement with ideas, experiences, and cognitive agents. This creates co-evolutionary relationships where human and artificial intelligence adapt to each other&#39;s development (Kauffman, 1995), transforming episodic encounters into continuous cognitive collaboration where interactions build upon previous understanding.</p><p><strong>Individual agency</strong> ensures learners maintain complete control over personal context, preserving what Freire (1970) described as the learner&#39;s role as &quot;critical co-investigator&quot; rather than passive recipient. This principle responds to power asymmetries in current AI systems, maintaining the humanising aspects of education within technological mediation and ensuring learners retain authorship over cognitive development and meaning-making processes.</p><p><strong>Cognitive extension</strong> positions AI as amplifiers of human reasoning rather than substitutes, drawing on distributed cognition research and extended mind thesis (Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998). This creates &quot;cognitive ecology&quot; where human and artificial intelligence form integrated systems enhancing rather than diminishing human capabilities. Meaningful cognitive extension requires deep understanding of human cognitive partners—their reasoning patterns, knowledge structures, and meaning-making approaches.</p><p>These principles manifest through interconnected operational dimensions. <strong>Personal context curation</strong> requires learners to develop metacognitive awareness of learning patterns, knowledge structures, and intellectual goals, transforming Schön&#39;s (1983) &quot;reflection-in-action&quot; into systematic approaches for making thinking visible to AI collaboration. Context curation creates structured representations—notes, reflections, knowledge maps—serving as interfaces between human cognition and AI systems, transforming personal knowledge management from passive archives into active cognitive infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Persistent cognitive partnership</strong> operationalises persistent understanding by creating mechanisms enabling AI systems to develop deeper understanding of intellectual patterns, reasoning approaches, and learning objectives. This continuity enables &quot;longitudinal learning intelligence&quot; that grows valuable over time, recognising recurring themes, identifying persistent knowledge gaps, and suggesting connections between disparate interest areas.</p><p><strong>Contextual interoperability</strong> addresses challenges of separating intelligence services from personal data storage, enabling sophisticated AI reasoning access whilst maintaining direct control over personal context. Context remains private and locally controlled whilst AI intelligence is accessed as utility service, ensuring learners benefit from powerful AI capabilities without compromising autonomy over personal information or meaning-making processes.</p><p><strong>Dynamic context evolution</strong> accommodates continuous understanding transformation whilst maintaining coherent personal context supporting ongoing learning. This requires tracking understanding evolution over time, documenting current knowledge and intellectual development trajectories, enabling AI systems to understand not only current thinking but development patterns and potential directions.</p><p>Context sovereignty represents interconnected conceptual shifts constituting a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Current Approach</th><th>Context Sovereignty</th><th>Significance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Episodic interactions</td><td>Persistent relationships</td><td>Eliminates cognitive overhead of repeated contextualisation</td></tr><tr><td>Explicit context articulation</td><td>Implicit contextual understanding</td><td>Enables natural, efficient communication</td></tr><tr><td>Generic AI capabilities</td><td>Personalised cognitive extension</td><td>Transforms AI from tool to thinking partner</td></tr><tr><td>Information sharing</td><td>Meaning preservation</td><td>Maintains personal significance of knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>Data extraction models</td><td>Individual data sovereignty</td><td>Preserves privacy whilst accessing intelligence</td></tr><tr><td>Human adaptation to AI</td><td>AI adaptation to human patterns</td><td>Centres human agency in the relationship</td></tr><tr><td>Prompting skills</td><td>Context curation capabilities</td><td>Develops metacognitive awareness of personal knowledge</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These shifts collectively represent movement from AI-centric to human-centric collaboration, where AI systems become media through which learners extend thinking capabilities rather than separate entities requiring constant orientation and instruction.</p><h2 id="challenges-and-considerations" tabindex="-1">Challenges and considerations <a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-and-considerations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Challenges and considerations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Several potential challenges to implementing context sovereignty warrant acknowledgement, demonstrating serious consideration within broader conceptual development. Critics might argue the approach lacks novelty, representing merely repackaged existing technologies like federated learning and privacy-preserving computation. However, this misses the conceptual significance of repositioning personal context as central to human-AI collaboration rather than treating privacy as afterthought. The framework addresses fundamental questions about agency, meaning-making, and cognitive partnership extending beyond technical implementations.</p><p>The privacy paradox—research showing people claim to value privacy whilst routinely trading it for convenience (Norberg et al., 2007)—presents more substantial concern. Context sovereignty addresses this by making privacy more convenient rather than requiring functionality sacrifice. By separating intelligence services from personal data storage, the framework enables sophisticated AI capability access without compromising individual control over personal information, avoiding forced choices between privacy and functionality.</p><p>Context maintenance cognitive overhead presents another consideration. Rather than eliminating cognitive work, context sovereignty shifts it from reactive to proactive management. Initial contextual infrastructure establishment is substantial, requiring new metacognitive awareness and knowledge organisation skills. However, this represents investment in &quot;cognitive capital&quot;—structured knowledge becoming increasingly valuable over time. Once established, contextual infrastructure integrates with existing learning practices, transforming routine note-taking, reflection, and knowledge organisation into AI partnership capability investments.</p><p>AI response quality remains constrained by users&#39; context curation capabilities, suggesting need for new digital literacy focused on metacognitive awareness and knowledge organisation. This requirement represents opportunity to develop sophisticated learning capabilities valuable independent of AI interaction. Context curation skills—reflective practice, knowledge organisation, metacognitive awareness—constitute foundational lifelong learning capabilities enhancing human cognitive development whether or not AI systems are involved.</p><p>Concerns about increased AI interaction complexity must be weighed against current cognitive burden of constant re-contextualisation. Context sovereignty trades episodic orientation overhead for persistent cognitive partnership development becoming more valuable over time, representing shift from immediate convenience to long-term capability development, acknowledging meaningful learning partnerships require investment rather than automatic emergence from casual interaction.</p><h2 id="implications-of-context-sovereignty-for-learning" tabindex="-1">Implications of context sovereignty for learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#implications-of-context-sovereignty-for-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implications of context sovereignty for learning&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Context sovereignty generates profound implications for learning design, addressing persistent concerns whilst creating new possibilities emerging from complex, dynamic understanding of context.</p><h3 id="transforming-personalised-learning-from-content-delivery-to-cognitive-partnership" tabindex="-1">Transforming personalised learning from content delivery to cognitive partnership <a class="header-anchor" href="#transforming-personalised-learning-from-content-delivery-to-cognitive-partnership" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transforming personalised learning from content delivery to cognitive partnership&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Context sovereignty fundamentally reframes personalised learning by shifting from content adaptation to cognitive partnership. Traditional systems operate through algorithmic content matching, adjusting difficulty or sequences based on performance indicators, treating personalisation as optimisation—finding right content for right learner at right time. Context sovereignty suggests cognitive partnership where AI systems adapt reasoning processes to align with individual cognitive patterns and meaning-making frameworks. This reflects complexity theory insight that learning systems are characterised by emergence and non-linear dynamics rather than predictable relationships. In cognitive partnership, AI develops understanding of how particular learners think—reasoning patterns, connection-making approaches, values and motivations—rather than simply tracking knowledge. This enables personalisation respecting learners&#39; irreducible contextual individuality whilst providing sophisticated support building upon rather than replacing human cognitive capabilities.</p><h3 id="context-as-foundation-for-productive-intellectual-challenge" tabindex="-1">Context as foundation for productive intellectual challenge <a class="header-anchor" href="#context-as-foundation-for-productive-intellectual-challenge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Context as foundation for productive intellectual challenge&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Context sovereignty addresses concerns about intellectual echo chambers by enabling more sophisticated challenge. Productive intellectual challenge emerges from engagement understanding existing positions deeply enough to identify genuine limitations, contradictions, or unexplored implications rather than from random opposition or generic alternatives. When AI systems have rich understanding of learners&#39; intellectual frameworks—values, assumptions, reasoning patterns, knowledge structures—they become capable of precisely calibrated challenges targeting productive tension points.</p><p>Rather than presenting opposing viewpoints easily dismissed as irrelevant, AI can identify specific thinking aspects meriting exploration or refinement, surfacing contradictions between beliefs, identifying assumptions lacking evidential support, or suggesting alternative evidence interpretations the learner finds meaningful. Current educational landscapes already suffer from intellectual homogeneity, with alternative perspective encounters occurring largely accidentally. Context sovereignty enables deliberate intellectual diversity introduction connecting meaningfully with learners&#39; existing frameworks rather than overwhelming with generic alternatives.</p><h3 id="distributed-context-sovereignty-and-collaborative-learning" tabindex="-1">Distributed context sovereignty and collaborative learning <a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-context-sovereignty-and-collaborative-learning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Distributed context sovereignty and collaborative learning&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Context sovereignty enables new collaborative learning forms through &quot;distributed contextual awareness&quot;—learning environments where multiple contextually-aware AI systems interact whilst maintaining clear context sharing boundaries. Professional education settings might see learners bringing personal AI agents into institutional contexts, where agents encounter and selectively integrate institutional context—values, processes, knowledge frameworks. This creates &quot;structural coupling&quot; where different systems maintain identity whilst developing coordinated responses to shared challenges (Maturana &amp; Varela, 1987). This distributed approach suggests collaborative learning transcending traditional group work limitations. Rather than adapting to common lowest denominators, distributed context sovereignty enables collaboration where individual differences become collective learning resources, with AI systems identifying productive complementarities between participants&#39; knowledge and perspectives.</p><h3 id="reconceptualising-authentic-intellectual-work-and-assessment" tabindex="-1">Reconceptualising authentic intellectual work and assessment <a class="header-anchor" href="#reconceptualising-authentic-intellectual-work-and-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reconceptualising authentic intellectual work and assessment&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Context sovereignty suggests reframing educational goals rather than maintaining artificial boundaries between human and artificial intelligence. Instead of asking &quot;What did the student know without AI assistance?&quot;, we might ask &quot;What important problem did the student and AI solve together?&quot; or &quot;How effectively did the student mobilise contextual knowledge through AI partnership?&quot; This acknowledges that professional and civic contexts will include AI assistance, making effective AI collaboration crucial rather than threatening authenticity. This suggests assessment focusing on collaborative problem-solving rather than isolated knowledge demonstration—examining learners&#39; capacity to curate relevant context, guide AI reasoning toward productive insights, and critically evaluate AI-generated ideas within personal knowledge frameworks. Such assessment recognises authentic intellectual work as sophisticated orchestration of human and artificial cognitive capabilities.</p><h3 id="preserving-human-agency-whilst-enabling-cognitive-amplification" tabindex="-1">Preserving human agency whilst enabling cognitive amplification <a class="header-anchor" href="#preserving-human-agency-whilst-enabling-cognitive-amplification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Preserving human agency whilst enabling cognitive amplification&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Context sovereignty&#39;s most significant implication lies in preserving and enhancing human agency with sophisticated AI systems. By positioning personal context centrally, the framework ensures AI systems adapt to human thinking patterns rather than requiring human adaptation to AI constraints, creating &quot;cognitive amplification&quot; where AI increases reach, sophistication, and effectiveness of human reasoning whilst preserving human authorship over learning processes.</p><h2 id="conclusion-toward-human-centred-ai-in-education" tabindex="-1">Conclusion: Toward human-centred AI in education <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion-toward-human-centred-ai-in-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion: Toward human-centred AI in education&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Context sovereignty offers a vision of AI in education preserving human agency whilst enabling genuine cognitive partnership. The shift from prompting to context sovereignty represents paradigmatic reimagining of human-AI relationships with profound implications for understanding learning, knowledge, and human development. The theoretical foundations reveal context as a complex adaptive system characterised by emergence and relational dynamics rather than static information. This suggests meaningful personalisation emerges through AI systems adapting to human thinking patterns, creating cognitive ecology where human and artificial intelligence form integrated systems enhancing human capabilities. The three principles—persistent understanding, individual agency, and cognitive extension—enable more sophisticated intellectual challenge, collaborative learning preserving individual autonomy, and assessment practices recognising collaborative problem-solving as authentic intellectual achievement. The framework demonstrates how sophisticated AI capabilities can be accessed whilst maintaining complete individual control over personal information.</p><p>Context sovereignty points toward learning environments becoming spaces for cultivating sophisticated human-AI collaboration, assessment examining learners&#39; capacity to mobilise contextual knowledge through AI partnership, and educational institutions preparing learners for AI-augmented citizenship. This requires cultural and conceptual transformation in understanding education&#39;s purposes. What emerges is education treating AI as cognitive partner understanding and extending human thinking whilst respecting boundaries and preserving agency. The result is genuine cognitive partnership amplifying what is essentially human about learning whilst accessing what is powerful about artificial intelligence. Context sovereignty thus provides foundation for reimagining human-AI collaboration that preserves and enhances rather than diminishes human capabilities.</p></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-39a288b8 data-v-e257564d><!--[--><!--]--><!----><nav class="prev-next" aria-labelledby="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d><span class="visually-hidden" id="doc-footer-aria-label" data-v-e257564d>Pager</span><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><!----></div><div class="pager" data-v-e257564d><a class="VPLink link pager-link next" href="/what.html" data-v-e257564d><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-e257564d>Next page</span><span class="title" data-v-e257564d>What is it?</span><!--]--></a></div></nav></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><!----><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
