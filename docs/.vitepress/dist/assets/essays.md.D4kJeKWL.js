The ACADEMIC framework proposes integrating AI into health professions education by focusing on learning processes rather than outputs, based on theoretical principles across six dimensions of learning interactions. Rather than seeing AI as merely a content delivery tool or threat to academic integrity, the framework positions it as a learning partner that can address persistent challenges and better prepare students for the complexity and collaborative nature of modern healthcare practice.</p><p><a href="/essays/theoretical-framework-ai-integration-hpe.html">Read more</a></p><h2 id="from-teaching-to-learning-how-emergent-scholarship-disrupts-traditional-education-hierarchies" tabindex="-1">From teaching to learning: How emergent scholarship disrupts traditional education hierarchies <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-teaching-to-learning-how-emergent-scholarship-disrupts-traditional-education-hierarchies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;From teaching to learning: How emergent scholarship disrupts traditional education hierarchies&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This essay argues that traditional higher education models built around teaching hierarchies are increasingly misaligned with how learning actually occurs in our information-rich, technology-enabled world. Emergent scholarship offers an alternative approach that reconceptualises learning as a networked process where knowledge emerges from connections between diverse participants rather than flowing &#39;downhill&#39; from experts to novices. This transformation requires reimagining not just pedagogical approaches but institutions themselves, creating new kinds learning environments that better prepare graduates for complexity while fostering more meaningful experiences for all participants.</p><p><a href="/essays/from-teaching-to-learning.html">Read more</a></p><h2 id="publishing-with-purpose-using-ai-to-enhance-scientific-discourse" tabindex="-1">Publishing with purpose: Using AI to enhance scientific discourse <a class="header-anchor" href="#publishing-with-purpose-using-ai-to-enhance-scientific-discourse" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Publishing with purpose: Using AI to enhance scientific discourse&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The use of generative AI in the scientific publishing system offers opportunities to enhance research processes, but risks reinforcing the problematic &quot;research industrial complex&quot; that represents the capture of academic scholarship. I argue that journals and editors must leverage AI to transform publishing into vibrant learning communities that facilitate discourse and collaborative engagement. This transformation requires coordinated action across stakeholders willing to prioritise the core purpose of advancing scientific knowledge, despite the entrenched incentives of the current academic publising ecosystem.</p><p><a href="/essays/publishing-with-purpose.html">Read more</a></p><h2 id="from-journals-to-networks-how-transparency-transforms-trust-in-scholarship" tabindex="-1">From journals to networks: How transparency transforms trust in scholarship <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-journals-to-networks-how-transparency-transforms-trust-in-scholarship" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;From journals to networks: How transparency transforms trust in scholarship&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The essay critiques the academic system where trust is outsourced to publishers and journals, proposing instead a framework based on visible scholarly processes rather than institutional proxies. It advocates for a three-tier technical approach that maintains compatibility with traditional structures while creating new possibilities: a live working environment, preprints with DOIs, and journal publication. While offering benefits like greater autonomy and transparency, this approach also presents challenges including technical barriers, potential fragmentation, and resource demands.</p><p><a href="/essays/transparency-transforms-trust.html">Read more</a></p><h2 id="technological-nature-of-language-and-the-implications-for-health-professions-education" tabindex="-1">Technological nature of language and the implications for health professions education <a class="header-anchor" href="#technological-nature-of-language-and-the-implications-for-health-professions-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technological nature of language and the implications for health professions education&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="/essays/technological-nature-of-language.html">Read more</a></p><p>This essay examines language as humanity&#39;s original general purpose technology and presents large language models as a significant evolution in this continuum rather than merely new digital tools. It explores how LLMs extend language&#39;s core capabilities through scale, synthesis, adaptability, and multimodality, which is especially relevant to health professions education where students struggle with information overload and preparation for complex practice environments. By framing LLMs as an evolution of our fundamental technology, the essay suggests shifting educational focus to clinical reasoning and adaptive expertise, developing healthcare-specific AI literacy, and reimagining assessment approaches—offering a balanced perspective between uncritical enthusiasm and reflexive resistance.</p>',17)]))}const g=a(s,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
