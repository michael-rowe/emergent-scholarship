The essential components are markdown-based writing and GitHub for transparent version control and collaboration.</p><p>This process creates a living document that anyone can see evolve, contribute to, and engage with (via the Github repo and published website), while still maintaining academically viable versions for citation purposes (preprint and journal submissions).</p><p>While the initial idea might seem overly complicated, it&#39;s almost all automated and takes seconds to go from editing in Obsidian, to an updated website. The manual submission to Zenodo for the DOI, and minor editing required, are nothing compared to the hoops we have to jump through with journal submissions.</p><p>This system enables me to rapidly <a href="/essays.html">create and publish live documents</a> that evolve transparently while maintaining academically citable versions.

Traditional academic writing processes—centred around journal and publisher ecosystems—both reflect and reinforce closed, hierarchical knowledge systems. The academic writing workflow described here isn&#39;t only a technical choice; it&#39;s a deliberate effort to create bridges between how we talk about scholarship and how we actually practise it.</p><p>There&#39;s an important power dynamic at play here. The traditional publishing system gives the industry a lot of power in choosing the direction and pace of knowledge creation and dissemination. They determine what gets published, when, and how it&#39;s distributed—often putting it behind paywalls that limit who can access cutting edge ideas. I describe this as the <a href="/essays/publishing-with-purpose.html">research industrial complex</a>; a system that prioritises publication metrics and profit over meaningful scientific progress.</p><p>My approach to academic writing is a way of replicating some of the functionality of the closed publishing system while taking back some of that power, particularly around the timing, format, and accessibility of knowledge sharing.</p><p>Through these concrete technical practices, I&#39;m trying to not only theorise about emergent scholarship but also enact it, demonstrating its principles through the process I use to describe them.</p><h2 id="problems-this-addresses" tabindex="-1">Problems this addresses <a class="header-anchor" href="#problems-this-addresses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problems this addresses&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This approach directly takes on several important challenges in existing scholarly practices:</p><h3 id="writing-experience" tabindex="-1">Writing experience <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-experience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Writing experience&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Word processors often impose unnecessary complexity that gets in the way of writing. Markdown provides a distraction-free environment that separates content creation from formatting concerns, allowing writers to focus on what matters most—their ideas.</p><h3 id="reviewer-recognition" tabindex="-1">Reviewer recognition <a class="header-anchor" href="#reviewer-recognition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reviewer recognition&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In traditional publishing, peer reviewers (might) make significant intellectual contributions but receive minimal recognition, even with open peer review processes. GitHub&#39;s issue-based discussions create permanent, citable records of all contributions, properly acknowledging everyone who shapes the work rather than relegating them to a brief acknowledgement or, more likely, anonymity. It will also address the <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2023/01/26/for-epistemic-respect-against-reviewer-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reviewer 2 problem</a>, and possibly help support more collegial and scholarly discussion and debate.</p><h3 id="reviewer-recruitment" tabindex="-1">Reviewer recruitment <a class="header-anchor" href="#reviewer-recruitment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reviewer recruitment&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It isn&#39;t much discussed, but many editors rely for peer review on &quot;whoever said yes&quot; rather than ideal expertise, given the difficulty of finding reviewers. Open GitHub discussions allow for broader, more diverse feedback while maintaining transparency about who contributed what—making the quality and context of review visible to all. I know that some people reading this will be wondering about the issues that come with inviting your own peer reviewers to go through your writing, but 1) we often have to suggest peer reviewers to editors anyway, and 2) this is all public, so it would make gaming the system challenging over time.</p><h3 id="knowledge-evolution" tabindex="-1">Knowledge evolution <a class="header-anchor" href="#knowledge-evolution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Knowledge evolution&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Traditional publishing freezes knowledge at a point in time. This isn&#39;t a bad thing but encourages a perspective that publication is an end-point in the research process. This workflow maintains living documents that can evolve while still providing stable snapshots through DOIs for citation purposes, acknowledging that knowledge is never truly static.</p><h3 id="power-redistribution" tabindex="-1">Power redistribution <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-redistribution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Power redistribution&quot;">​</a></h3><p>By controlling the means of production and distribution, this approach shifts power away from publishers and back to scholars and communities. It allows for immediate sharing of ideas rather than waiting months or years for publication, and it makes knowledge freely accessible rather than locked behind paywalls.</p><hr><p>This project remains an experiment—a bridge between established academic practices and new possibilities that technology enables. It doesn&#39;t reject traditional scholarship but extends it, creating pathways for knowledge to develop more openly, collaboratively, and transparently.</p>',45)]))}const g=i(r,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
