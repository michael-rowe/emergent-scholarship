GitHub offers several features that make it ideal for this kind of collaborative scholarly work:</p><ul><li>Anyone can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fork</a> any part of this project to create their own version, which can be developed independently</li><li>Anyone can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clone</a> the entire project onto their computer and edit it separately from the public version</li><li>Anyone can contribute changes to any part of the project, including essays or principles (though this requires some additional steps)</li><li>Anyone can make comments or suggest changes that become part of the public, tracked record of the project</li></ul><p>This approach to scholarly collaboration mirrors the <a href="/principles.html">emergent scholarship principles</a> we&#39;re exploring. Knowledge develops through connections, innovation happens through openness, and value emerges through engagement with diverse perspectives.</p><p>While these features create powerful opportunities for collaboration, they do require some technical knowledge. There&#39;s a learning curve involved, but this isn&#39;t necessarily a drawback. After all, attempting to transform established systems of scholarship was never going to be simple.</p><h2 id="current-ways-to-contribute" tabindex="-1">Current ways to contribute <a class="header-anchor" href="#current-ways-to-contribute" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Current ways to contribute&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As the project is still developing, there are several ways you can contribute right now:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Share and discuss</strong>: Share links to any part of the project to raise awareness about alternative approaches to scholarship. Start conversations in your own networks about emergent principles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Open peer review</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/michael-rowe/emergent-scholarship/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Create an Issue</a> on GitHub to offer feedback, suggest improvements, or highlight connections to other work. Think of this as open and transparent peer review – visible to all and permanently part of the project&#39;s development record.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct collaboration</strong>: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Create a GitHub account</a> and request an invitation to collaborate (more about this process <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>). This allows you to become a co-creator of the project, with the ability to directly add and modify content.</p></li></ol><p>If the need arises, we&#39;ll develop more structured pathways for contribution, including collaborative writing projects, community discussions, and potentially a more accessible interface for non-technical contributors. The goal is to balance openness with quality, creating a scholarly environment where ideas can evolve through collective intelligence while maintaining intellectual rigour.</p>',9)]))}const d=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,d as default};
