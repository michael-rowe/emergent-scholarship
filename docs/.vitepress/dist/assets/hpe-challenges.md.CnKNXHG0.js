Let me explore how these principles could transform our approach to common problems beyond assessment.</p><h2 id="clinical-placement-shortages" tabindex="-1">Clinical Placement Shortages <a class="header-anchor" href="#clinical-placement-shortages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Clinical Placement Shortages&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Competition for limited sites, rationing of experiences, simulation as a separate alternative</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge through Connection:</strong> Create networks of diverse learning settings beyond traditional sites (community centers, telehealth hubs, rural partnerships)</li><li><strong>Information Flow through Networks:</strong> Develop digital platforms where learners across sites share experiences, creating collective learning from distributed placements</li><li><strong>Innovation through Openness:</strong> Partner with non-traditional sites to co-create new models of student participation</li><li><strong>Value through Engagement:</strong> Measure success through community impact and service enhancement, not just hours completed</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> A distributed learning network where students rotate through combinations of traditional, community, and virtual settings while contributing to a shared knowledge repository that reveals patterns and insights impossible to gain at any single site.</p><h2 id="interprofessional-education-implementation" tabindex="-1">Interprofessional Education Implementation <a class="header-anchor" href="#interprofessional-education-implementation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interprofessional Education Implementation&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Scheduled joint sessions, simulated teamwork, case discussions with artificial team compositions</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Identity through Community:</strong> Develop authentic communities of practice where multiple professions learn through collaborative work</li><li><strong>Meaning through Medium:</strong> Use the medium of real-world documentation and communication tools that shape actual interprofessional practice</li><li><strong>Sustainability through Ecology:</strong> Design systems where interprofessional learning emerges naturally from clinical needs rather than requiring additional resources</li><li><strong>Information Flow through Networks:</strong> Create digital spaces where interprofessional knowledge sharing happens asynchronously and organically</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> Learning communities anchored in actual clinical microsystems where students from different professions contribute to quality improvement initiatives, creating authentic teamwork that simultaneously improves care and develops collaborative competencies.</p><h2 id="teaching-clinical-reasoning" tabindex="-1">Teaching Clinical Reasoning <a class="header-anchor" href="#teaching-clinical-reasoning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Teaching Clinical Reasoning&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Case-based discussions, diagnostic pattern recognition, hypothetico-deductive reasoning models taught in isolation</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge through Connection:</strong> Position clinical reasoning as emerging from connections between biomedical knowledge, patient experiences, and contextual factors</li><li><strong>Innovation through Openness:</strong> Make expert reasoning visible through open sharing of thinking processes across experience levels</li><li><strong>Meaning through Medium:</strong> Use diverse media (visual, narrative, embodied) to develop different aspects of reasoning</li><li><strong>Value through Engagement:</strong> Evaluate reasoning through its impact on patient-centered outcomes, not just diagnostic accuracy</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> A clinical reasoning program where students learn through transparent access to experts&#39; thinking processes, engage with patient experiences in multiple formats, and develop facility with both algorithmic and narrative approaches to understanding clinical problems.</p><h2 id="curriculum-overload" tabindex="-1">Curriculum Overload <a class="header-anchor" href="#curriculum-overload" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Curriculum Overload&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Content reduction efforts, clearer objectives, more efficient teaching methods</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sustainability through Ecology:</strong> Design learning systems that respect cognitive limits and prioritize depth over breadth</li><li><strong>Knowledge through Connection:</strong> Focus on developing connection-making skills rather than comprehensive knowledge</li><li><strong>Information Flow through Networks:</strong> Teach information navigation and filtering rather than memorization</li><li><strong>Identity through Community:</strong> Build learning communities where knowledge is distributed across the network, not solely in individual minds</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> A curriculum organized around core concepts and connections rather than comprehensive coverage, with students developing skills in accessing, evaluating, and applying information within professional communities rather than memorizing rapidly changing content.</p><h2 id="faculty-development-challenges" tabindex="-1">Faculty Development Challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="#faculty-development-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Faculty Development Challenges&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Workshops, incentives for teaching, centralized instructional development programs</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Innovation through Openness:</strong> Create open sharing platforms for teaching approaches and materials</li><li><strong>Identity through Community:</strong> Develop teaching communities that strengthen educator identity</li><li><strong>Value through Engagement:</strong> Recognize diverse forms of educational scholarship beyond traditional research</li><li><strong>Meaning through Medium:</strong> Use multiple formats for faculty development, matching medium to message</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> A faculty development ecosystem where teaching innovations emerge through communities of practice, with recognition systems that value multiple forms of educational impact and development opportunities that model the very pedagogical approaches being promoted.</p><h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion-challenges" tabindex="-1">Diversity and Inclusion Challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="#diversity-and-inclusion-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Diversity and Inclusion Challenges&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Targeted recruitment, cultural competence training, policy statements</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge through Connection:</strong> Create spaces for diverse knowledge systems to intersect and transform understanding</li><li><strong>Identity through Community:</strong> Foster communities where multiple identities are not just included but essential to collective learning</li><li><strong>Value through Engagement:</strong> Center the perspectives of marginalized groups in determining what constitutes educational value</li><li><strong>Sustainability through Ecology:</strong> Design systems where diversity sustains innovation and adaptability</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> Learning environments where diversity drives innovation rather than being simply accommodated, with curriculum development processes that center marginalized perspectives and evaluation systems that measure inclusion impact beyond numerical representation.</p><h2 id="technology-integration" tabindex="-1">Technology Integration <a class="header-anchor" href="#technology-integration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technology Integration&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong> Tool-focused adoption, standardized platforms, technology as an add-on to existing approaches</p><p><strong>Emergent scholarship approach:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Meaning through Medium:</strong> Select technologies based on how their affordances shape the learning experience</li><li><strong>Innovation through Openness:</strong> Create spaces for experimental approaches and rapid adaptation</li><li><strong>Information Flow through Networks:</strong> Design technology ecosystems rather than isolated tools</li><li><strong>Sustainability through Ecology:</strong> Evaluate technology choices based on human and environmental impact</li></ul><p><strong>Practical transformation:</strong> A technology integration approach focused on how digital tools transform learning relationships rather than simply deliver content, with thoughtful consideration of how different mediums shape different aspects of professional development.</p><hr><p>What&#39;s powerful about applying emergent scholarship principles to these common challenges is how they shift our focus from isolated solutions to interconnected transformations. Rather than trying to solve each problem separately, we begin to see how changes in one area create ripple effects throughout the entire educational ecosystem.</p><p>Would you like me to explore any of these challenges in greater depth, or perhaps address a specific health professions education challenge that&#39;s particularly relevant to your context?</p>',40)]))}const u=t(a,[["render",r]]);export{d as __pageData,u as default};
