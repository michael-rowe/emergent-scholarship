Traditional academic writing processes—centred around word processors and email exchanges—both reflect and reinforce closed, hierarchical knowledge systems. This new academic writing workflow isn&#39;t only a technical choice; it&#39;s a deliberate effort to create bridges between how we talk about scholarship and how we actually practise it.</p><p>This workflow enables a low-cost, near frictionless method for open scholarly practice and rapid dissemination of academic work, while also directly challenging the publishing industry&#39;s control over publication. By managing our own means of creation, production, distribution, and archival channels, we shift power back to scholars and communities, making knowledge more accessible and allowing for more responsive, evolving scholarship.</p><h2 id="writing-process-overview" tabindex="-1">Writing process overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-process-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Writing process overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Here&#39;s how my academic writing and publication process works:</p><ol><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Markdown</a> for writing: Plain text with simple formatting that focuses on content rather than presentation (I do most of my writing in <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Obsidian</a>)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Git</a>/<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> for versioning and collaboration: Version control with transparent history, public engagement, and the possibility of peer review</li><li><a href="https://vitepress.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VitePress</a> for presentation: Automated conversion of markdown to a readable website (this site is built with Vitepress)</li><li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Netlify</a> for deployment: Automated publishing of the &quot;live&quot; version of the document, initially with no DOI</li><li>Manual <a href="https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zenodo</a> submission: For creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DOIs</a> and permanent snapshots through preprints (I will also start adding the preprints to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> for long-term archiving)</li><li>Journal submission: If I decide to, I can submit the preprint to a traditional academic journal for a more traditional publication</li></ol><p>This system enables me to rapidly create and publish live documents that evolve transparently while maintaining academically citable versions.
