# About Emergent Scholarship

Emergent scholarship is a forward-looking, interdisciplinary approach to knowledge creation and dissemination, embracing the principles of emergence observed in complex systems.

I am an Associate Professor and Director of Digital Innovation in the School of Health and Care Sciences at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom.

My early research led to a PhD investigating the impact of blended learning in health professions education, laying the foundation for ongoing work exploring the intersection of technology and pedagogy.

My scholarship focuses on the transformative potential of digital technologies in education, with a particular interest in how they influence relationships between teachers and students in learning environments. Drawing on critical pedagogy and complexity science, my work focuses on the use of technological innovation to enhance both education and clinical practice while maintaining student-centred approaches to learning.

I am currently working on the implications of generative AI in health professions education and clinical practice.

## Writing workflow

I want to use a writing workflow in this project that isn't only *about* emergent scholarship, but which is directly informed *by* emergent scholarship. In other words, I want to use the principles to write about the principles.

1. Connection. Does the writing process enable knowledge by connecting ideas and people?
2. Networks. Does the writing process build relationships and explicitly integrate distributed knowledge?
3. Community. Does the writing process foster a learning community?
4. Openness. Is the writing process transparent and accessible?
5. Medium. Do my publishing choices use appropriate tools and platforms?
6. Engagement. Is there a way to engage through interactive learning experiences?
7. Mastery. Am I developing expertise through practice?
8. Ecology. Does the process help me to better understand systemic interactions?
