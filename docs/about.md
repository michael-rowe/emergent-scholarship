# About me

<img src="/media/Michael-Rowe-profile.png" alt="Profile photo of the author, Michael Rowe" class="right-aligned-image" style="width: 200px; ">

I am an Associate Professor and Director of Digital Innovation in the School of Health and Care Sciences at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom.

My early research led to a PhD investigating the impact of blended learning in health professions education, laying the foundation for ongoing work exploring the intersection of technology and pedagogy.

My scholarship focuses on the transformative potential of digital technologies in education, with a particular interest in how they influence relationships between teachers and students in learning environments. Drawing on critical pedagogy and complexity science, my work focuses on the use of technological innovation to enhance both education and practice while maintaining student-centred approaches to learning.
