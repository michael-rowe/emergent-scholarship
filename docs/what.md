# What is emergent scholarship?

Emergent scholarship is a forward-looking, interdisciplinary approach to knowledge creation and sharing that embraces complexity, connection, collaboration, adaptation, and public engagement. It represents an evolution of scholarly practice for our interconnected world, recognising that knowledge doesn't just flow linearly from experts to audiences but emerges dynamically from networks of diverse participants, technologies, and ideas.

Rather than rejecting traditional academic values like rigour, evidence, and expertise, emergent scholarship reimagines how these values can be realised in ways that are more connected, open, responsive, and sustainable.

hat emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and public engagement, integrating complexity and systems thinking to address dynamic, real-world problems.

Emergent scholarship is both a process for, and object of, inquiry, which means we can use the [principles of emergent scholarship](principles.md) to study emergent scholarship.
