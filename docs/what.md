# What is emergent scholarship?

Emergent scholarship is a forward-looking, interdisciplinary approach to knowledge creation, production, and dissemination that embraces complexity, connection, collaboration, adaptation, and public engagement. It represents an evolution of scholarly practice for our interconnected world, recognising that knowledge doesn't just flow linearly from experts to audiences but emerges dynamically from networks of diverse participants, technologies, and ideas. It promotes open access, diverse methodologies, and ethical, inclusive practices to produce holistic and impactful knowledge.

Rather than rejecting traditional academic values like rigour, evidence, and expertise, emergent scholarship reimagines how these values can be realised in ways that are more connected, open, responsive, and sustainable.

Emergent scholarship is both a process for, and object of, inquiry, which means we can use the [principles of emergent scholarship](principles.md) to study emergent scholarship.
