*The commons* is the set of resources held in common for the public benefit.

> Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism. Commons can also be defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.

Information can get stuck in institutional silos, presenting limitations and constraints on our ability to collaboration and share.

This is because the default position is that information - and technologies and processes implicated in the movement, storage, and access to information - comes to life in private, behind closed doors. And at some later stage must be released into a public space, typically through open access licensing.

Why not start in public?
