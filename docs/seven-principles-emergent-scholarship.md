The emergent scholarship approach doesn't reject traditional academic values like rigour, evidence, and expertise. Rather, it reimagines how these values can be realised in ways that are more connected, open, sustainable, and responsive to complex real-world challenges. It represents an evolution of scholarship appropriate for our increasingly complex, interconnected world.

Innovation is recombination. You have to give yourself lots of opportunities to recombine ideas. Which means you have to find lots of ideas. This feels like a core component of this set of principles.

## Knowledge through connection

- Knowledge is socially constructed through interaction and exchange
- Valuable insights emerge at the intersection of different perspectives and disciplines
- Understanding develops through both formal and informal exchanges across networks
- Collective intelligence surpasses individual efforts in creating robust knowledge

Theoretical foundation: Social constructivism (Vygotsky, Berger & Luckmann) and connectivism (Siemens & Downes)

## Information flow through networks

- Creating connections that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries
- Facilitating the movement of information across diverse contexts and communities
- Using scholarly networks to amplify and disseminate important messages
- Recognising that good ideas can emerge from anywhere and anyone in the network
- Leveraging technology to enhance human cognitive capacities within scholarly networks

Theoretical foundation: Network theory (Barab√°si, Castells) and diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers)

## Identity through community
    
- Building supportive environments that foster collective meaning-making
- Creating spaces where scholars develop and transform their professional identities
- Developing trusted relationships that enable risk-taking and innovation
- Cultivating environments where evaluation becomes developmental rather than judgemental
- Valuing collaborative achievements alongside individual contributions

Theoretical foundation: Communities of practice (Wenger) and situated learning theory

## Innovation through openness
    
- Making knowledge as open and accessible as possible, respecting ethical considerations
- Benefiting from early sharing and continuous feedback on scholarly work
- Creating conditions for unexpected connections and emergent insights
- Enhancing scholarly integrity through transparency in methods and data
- Public engagement enriches scholarly work

Theoretical foundation: Open innovation (Chesbrough), commons-based peer production (Benkler), and knowledge commons theory (Hess & Ostrom)

## Meaning through medium
    
- Choosing forms of expression that best serve the knowledge being shared
- Recognising that the medium shapes the message and influences how it's received
- Employing diverse formats to enhance understanding and engagement
- Methods and outputs can evolve as new possibilities emerge
- Technology enables scholarly expression

Theoretical foundation: Media ecology (McLuhan, Postman) and multimodal communication theory

## Value through engagement

- Developing multiple approaches to evaluating scholarly contributions
- Moving beyond citation metrics to more holistic assessments of value
- Viewing impact as an ongoing dialogue rather than a terminal outcome
- Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives in determining significance

Theoretical foundation: Participatory evaluation (Cousins & Whitmore) and values-engaged assessment (Greene)

## Resilience through mastery

- Developing deep knowledge and skills that enable adaptation to changing contexts
- Using disciplinary foundations as launch points for transdisciplinary exploration
- Viewing uncertainty as possibility when equipped with robust capabilities
- Finding stability in expertise while remaining open to new directions

Theoretical foundation: Adaptive expertise (Hatano & Inagaki) and psychological resilience theory

## Sustainability through ecology

- Situating scholarship within broader social and environmental ecosystems
- Designing practices that contribute to both academic and planetary well-being
- Embracing scholarship that remains relevant beyond academic boundaries
- Creating knowledge that respects natural limits and regenerative cycles
- Systems and processes should promote long-term thinking
- Scholarship should enhance rather than deplete human and environmental resources

Theoretical foundation: Social-ecological systems theory (Ostrom, Holling) and regenerative sustainability
