# What is Emergent Scholarship?

**Emergent scholarship** is an interdisciplinary approach to scholarship (academic research, teaching, and service) that emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and public engagement, integrating complexity and systems thinking to address dynamic, real-world problems. It promotes open access, diverse methodologies, and ethical, inclusive practices to produce holistic and impactful knowledge.

Emergent scholarship is both a process for, and object of, inquiry, which means we can use the [principles of emergent scholarship](principles.md) to study emergent scholarship.

## Features of emergent scholarship

- A focus on understanding the intricate dynamics, patterns, and behaviours that arise from the interactions and interconnections within and between complex adaptive systems, including networks, organisations, social structures, and technological ecosystems
- An openness to unconventional and evolving formats and channels for scholarly work, moving beyond traditional academic publishing models to encompass diverse media like blogs, podcasts, videos, and other digital platforms
- A commitment to maintaining the intellectual rigour, theoretical grounding, and peer-review processes that define robust scholarship, while exploring innovative ways to apply these principles in emergent contexts
- An interdisciplinary orientation that integrates insights and methodologies from fields like complexity science, network theory, computer science, sociology, education, and others, to holistically understand and engage with learning in community
- A public-facing and accessible approach to scholarship, positioning the creator as a "public intellectual" who is working to translate complex ideas into accessible formats and engage broader audiences in meaningful discourse
- A dynamic and adaptive mindset that embraces the ever-evolving nature of knowledge and the need to continuously refine and redefine scholarly practices in response to the changing scholarly landscape and technological advancements
