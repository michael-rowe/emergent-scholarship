# Multiple version of essays published here

You may have noticed that only some of these essays have DOIs. Here's why:

- I want to get ideas out into the world as quickly as possible, but I also want to make sure that those ideas are vetted and trustworthy
- So, I publish essays relatively quickly...basically, as soon as I'm not embarassed for them to be in public
- Those essays don't have a DOI; you can think of them as blog posts
- After a bit more work they start looking like something you might recognise as an 'article' and at this point I publish the work as a preprint and it gets a DOI
- The preprint version still isn't peer-reviewed, but this is typically the version I submit to a journal i.e. I'm satisfied that this meets some personal standard of quality
- Once the work goes through peer review and gets published, that version has it's own DOI and I link to it from this site

This process allows me to get work out into the world quickly, but with the caveat that it's just an opinion.

There are therefore 3 versions of the work:

1. The live version on this site, which will contine evolving and getting refined
2. The preprint version, which is a snapshot of the first version I think is good enough to submit for peer review
3. The published version, which is the 'version of record'
