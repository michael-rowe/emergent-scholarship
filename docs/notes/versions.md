# Multiple version of essays published here

You may have noticed that only some of these essays have DOIs. Here's why:

- I want to get ideas out into the world as quickly as possible, but I also want to make sure that they are vetted and trustworthy for readers
- So, I publish essays relatively quickly...basically, as soon as I'm not embarrassed for them to be in public
- On the day that these versions go live on this site, they are assigned a version number where anything less than 1.0 is a draft; something like a blog post
	- 0.5 - the first version I think is good enough to share; it's a full draft that represents a coherent expression of the idea
	- 0.7 - a more polished version that I've worked on a bit more; it's probably been though 1-2 rounds of edits
	- 0.9 - what I'd consider a final draft; it's been through multiple rounds of edits and is ready for submission to a journal; at this point I publish it as a preprint and it gets a DOI
	- 1.0 - the published version that's been through peer review and is the 'version of record'
	- 1.1, 1.2, etc. - minor updates to the published version; these are typically typos or small clarifications that don't change the meaning of the work
	- 1.5, 2.0, etc. - major updates that represent significant changes to the work (note that essays may never reach these versions)

This process allows me to get ideas out into the world quickly, but with the caveat that it's just an opinion.

There are therefore 3 versions of the work:

1. The live version on this site, which will continue evolving and getting refined (0.5, 0.7, 1.1, etc.)
2. The preprint (0.9), which is the first version I think is good enough for peer review
3. The published version (1.0), which is the 'version of record'
