## Abstract

Professional education curricula face a fundamental infrastructure problem: while comprehensively documented, they lack systematic queryability. Programme teams must demonstrate competency coverage for regulatory audits, which sometimes requires days or weeks of manual document review. Quality assurance staff need to manually cross-reference spreadsheets to verify assessment coverage. Module leads work in isolation, struggling to identify what colleagues teach or discover curriculum gaps. These artefacts of document-based infrastructure create artificial information scarcity through technical limitations.

We propose a three-layer architecture: graph databases storing curriculum structure as typed relationships (programmes contain modules, assessments test learning outcomes, outcomes map to competencies), vector databases enabling semantic content search, and the Model Context Protocol providing natural language interfaces, tool-use, and agents. The goal is not to create structure but to make existing structure computationally accessible.
