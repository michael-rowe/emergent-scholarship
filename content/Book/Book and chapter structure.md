Is there something about *ethics* that needs to come into the structure? Not a formal ethics review board, but an objective, independent system of checks to ensure that the process isn't harmful. This would look different in an informal, **personal scholarship**.

1. Introduction (problem + promise)
	1. Each chapter helps address this book-level problem: How to develop and maintain a systematic knowledge practice that lets you contribute meaningfully to conversations that matter
	2. the world is a complex place
	3. giving rise to wicked problems
	4. and we need more good ideas from more people to help address those problems
	5. but it's not just good ideas that we need; we also need people who are able to build them out, implement them, and evaluate how well they work
	6. and we can't leave this solely to the professional scholars (why?)
2. Scholarship, redefined (everyday scholarship; invisible networks; a preview of the toolkit)
	1. scholarship is a set of tools that 'professional learners' use to make sense of the world
	2. but scholarship isn't something that should be left to professionals
	3. anyone can use these tools to not only help make sense of the world, but to share what they've learned
	4. what are these tools? they're probably the kinds of things that you do already, but maybe not systematically
3. Learning and adapting (adaptive expertise; learning in public)
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you systematically develop competence in new domains fast enough to contribute meaningfully to ongoing conversations?
	2. before you can do any of this, you need to first update your assumptions about what it means 'to learn'
	3. because 
	4. learning starts with humility; an acceptance of the fact that you may be (and probably are) wrong, and a genuine belief that you can be less wrong
	5. many people don't think of themselves as learners
	6. you can become an expert in a domain (or at least, competent), without a degree
	7. why learning in public is a good thing (you never know what will spark a thought and inspire others; it also helps to stress-test your ideas)
4. Asking better questions
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you identify what's actually worth investigating when complex problems have no obvious starting point?
	2. many people start by looking for evidence that they're right
	3. you will almost certainly find this
	4. ask what it would take to convince you that you're wrong, and then look for that (this is sometimes referred to as 'science')
	5. better questions are premised on a well-defined articulation of the problem
	6. good questions contain everything you need to find good answers (the method is in the problem...or something like that)
5. Gathering evidence
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you find and evaluate reliable information in domains where you lack expert knowledge?
	2. we've never before had so much access to so much information
	3. we need information to help inform choices but too much is overwhelming, especially when a lot of it is bad information
	4. and it's getting more difficult to make a judgement about which information is useful or not useful (don't make value judgements i.e. good or bad)
	5. attention is the key
	6. is this essentially about critical thinking
6. Analysis and synthesis
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you integrate contradictory information from multiple sources to develop your own informed perspective?
7. Collaborating (distributed expertise)
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you learn from and work productively with people whose expertise differs significantly from yours?
	2. we don't want isolated expertise
	3. we want distributed expertise / intelligence
	4. the kinds of problems we face won't be addressed by independent people, or even independent disciplines
8. Communicating understanding (translation for impact)
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you share insights credibly when you lack traditional credentials in the domain?
	2. how do you share ideas that resonate?
	3. what doesn't work about sharing PDFs in expensive academic journals?
9. Creating impact (from knowledge to change)
	1. Problem the chapter aims to address: How do you turn knowledge into actionable change that actually matters to others?
	2. what is the purpose of what you do? what is your mission?
	3. how can you be useful?
	4. a core feature of scholarly work is that it is associated with action; it's about doing things in the world (where 'academic' might have a more theoretical focus)
10. Your scholarly practice (your synthesis; name the set; present the toolkit crisply; frameworks, pitfalls, routines)
	1. what I was calling the principles of emergent scholarship
	2. *knowledge through connection* could be the core principle (ideas flourish at the intersection of nodes in networks)

**Name the principle set.** In the synthesis chapter (chapter 9), explicitly name and define the principles in a half-page each, then show how they interlock as a “toolkit”.
