_Making knowledge actionable and publicly beneficial_

The systematic approaches you've developed through the previous chapters—learning systematically, asking productive questions, gathering information strategically, making sense of complex evidence, collaborating effectively, and communicating transparently—create genuine capability for navigating complexity. But capability alone doesn't determine whether your systematic thinking contributes meaningfully to the challenges facing others around you. Having developed robust methods for understanding complex problems, you face a choice about whether and how to direct that understanding toward change that benefits people beyond yourself. This involves designing approaches that transform individual learning into collective benefit, measuring impact through outcomes that matter in the real world rather than academic metrics, and recognising when contribution becomes possible versus when it feels necessary. The challenge is knowing how to make systematic thinking useful to others while understanding that personal competence development is valuable regardless of broader contribution.

**Chapter problem:** How do you turn knowledge into actionable change that actually matters to others?

## 1. The Hook

**PLACEHOLDER:** Need compelling, short (300 words), vivid anecdote showing positive consequences of transforming systematic understanding into actionable change that benefits others. Story should illustrate someone who developed solid research and analytical capabilities and then translated their insights into meaningful impact, leading to concrete stakes like achieved opportunities, fewer problems, or community success.

**Potential scenarios:**

**Stakes**: Concrete consequences include problems that were addressed, saved systematic thinking capabilities, achieved opportunities to help others facing similar challenges, or community/organisational issues that stopped because relevant knowledge became actionable change.

**Ending question**: How do you transform systematic understanding into changes that actually improve outcomes for the people and communities you want to help?

## 2. The problem unpacked

### Personal examples

**Professional transformation recommendations**: Sarah has systematically analysed her client's digital workflow challenges using the research methods from previous chapters. She interviewed staff across departments, analysed current processes, compared solutions from similar organisations, and developed evidence-based recommendations that could significantly improve productivity and reduce frustration. Her 30-page analysis clearly identifies bottlenecks, proposes specific technology solutions, and includes implementation timelines. However, when presenting to leadership, her recommendations sit in presentation slides while the 200+ employees continue struggling with the same daily frustrations. Despite having solid understanding of both the problems and solutions, Sarah can't bridge the gap between systematic analysis and organisational change that actually improves people's working lives.

**Educational methodology insights**: David has conducted thorough research into evidence-based teaching approaches after noticing student engagement declining in his school. Using systematic literature review methods, classroom observations, and student feedback analysis, he's identified specific pedagogical changes that could dramatically improve learning outcomes. His research shows clear evidence for more effective approaches to lesson planning, assessment methods, and student support systems. But his insights remain confined to informal conversations with colleagues who are too busy to implement changes, while students continue to struggle with learning approaches that his research shows are less effective. David has developed genuine expertise in educational methodology but cannot transform it into improved classroom experiences for the students who would benefit most.

**User research conclusions**: Maya has systematically investigated accessibility barriers in her company's fintech products, combining user interviews, technical analysis, and comparative research into industry standards. Her investigation reveals specific friction points that prevent users with disabilities from completing transactions, along with detailed solutions that would improve usability for everyone. She understands both the technical requirements and user needs better than anyone else in the organisation. However, her findings compete with other product priorities for engineering resources, and her recommendations remain in research documents while users continue facing barriers that her systematic work could eliminate. Maya has built sophisticated understanding of accessibility challenges but struggles to translate insights into product changes that would actually help users.

**Community sustainability analysis**: Tom has researched local energy consumption patterns and environmental impact using council data, academic studies, and resident surveys. His systematic analysis identifies specific, actionable solutions—from community solar programmes to waste reduction initiatives—that could significantly reduce neighbourhood carbon emissions while saving residents money. He understands both the environmental science and local implementation challenges better than anyone else in his community. But his research exists in personal files while the community continues practices that his analysis shows are both environmentally harmful and economically inefficient. Tom has developed genuine expertise in local sustainability challenges but cannot convert understanding into community action that would benefit everyone.

**Workplace culture investigation**: Jennifer has systematically analysed communication breakdown patterns in her team using structured interviews, meeting observations, and workflow analysis. Her research reveals specific organisational dynamics that create stress, reduce productivity, and cause talented staff to leave. She's identified evidence-based interventions that could improve team collaboration and job satisfaction for everyone involved. However, her insights become the basis for informal conversations rather than systematic changes, while colleagues continue experiencing the workplace frustrations that her analysis could address. Jennifer has built sophisticated understanding of organisational dynamics but struggles to transform insights into management changes that would actually improve working conditions.

**Healthcare advocacy research**: Marcus has systematically researched treatment options for his elderly parent's complex medical conditions, combining clinical literature review, specialist consultations, and analysis of local service quality. His research reveals care approaches that could significantly improve quality of life while reducing healthcare costs, and he understands the medical evidence better than most healthcare providers involved in his parent's care. But his systematic research remains separate from actual care decisions, while his parent receives standard treatments that Marcus's analysis suggests are less effective than available alternatives. Despite developing genuine expertise in relevant medical evidence, Marcus cannot translate understanding into improved healthcare outcomes for his parent.

### Why this is more complex than it appears

Most people assume that good research naturally leads to positive change—if your analysis is solid and your recommendations sound, surely others will recognise the value and implement improvements. This feels intuitive because systematic thinking does create genuine understanding and often identifies actionable solutions. But this assumption systematically fails for exactly the types of challenges above, and the failure isn't about research quality or recommendation clarity.

The fundamental problem is that **creating change requires fundamentally different capabilities from creating understanding**. Sarah's workflow analysis might be excellent, but organisational change requires navigating politics, resource constraints, competing priorities, and implementation complexities that weren't part of her research scope. Marcus's medical research might be thorough, but healthcare advocacy requires understanding clinical decision-making processes, insurance systems, and doctor-patient communication dynamics that systematic literature review doesn't address.

This becomes especially challenging because **impact often requires influencing people and systems beyond your direct control**. David's educational insights can only improve student outcomes if busy teachers adopt new approaches, school leadership supports implementation, and parents understand the changes. Jennifer's workplace analysis only creates better team dynamics if management commits resources to organisational change and colleagues modify established communication patterns. The gap between understanding what should happen and making it actually happen involves coordinating multiple stakeholders who may have different priorities, constraints, and perspectives.

Perhaps most problematically, **systematic thinkers often underestimate the change management challenge while overestimating the persuasive power of good analysis**. Tom assumes that demonstrating clear environmental and economic benefits will motivate community action, but collective behaviour change requires social coordination, leadership development, and sustained engagement that extends far beyond research findings. Maya believes that demonstrating accessibility barriers will trigger product improvements, but organisational change requires resource allocation, priority negotiation, and implementation planning that don't automatically follow from research conclusions.

The underlying challenge is that impact requires designing and implementing interventions that work within existing social, organisational, and political systems rather than hoping that good understanding automatically translates into positive change.

This difficulty reflects a broader challenge that even academic researchers face: **the controlled conditions that enable systematic analysis rarely exist in the messy contexts where change must actually happen**. When Sarah analyses workflow problems, she can define clear boundaries, control variables, and focus on specific aspects without interference. But implementing change requires navigating office politics, budget cycles, competing software vendors, staff training schedules, and dozens of other factors that weren't part of her analytical framework. Similarly, academic researchers often struggle when controlled laboratory findings meet complex real-world implementation environments—the clean conditions that enabled rigorous research don't exist in the social, economic, and political contexts where interventions must actually work. This gap between analytical clarity and implementation messiness explains why solid research often fails to create expected change, regardless of whether it originates from individual systematic thinking or formal academic institutions.

### Common features

These impact challenges share several patterns that complicate the translation from understanding to change:

- **Multiple stakeholder coordination required**: Change depends on people with different priorities, constraints, and decision-making authority working together in ways that individual research cannot control or predict
- **Implementation complexity beyond research scope**: Understanding problems and solutions differs fundamentally from navigating organisational politics, resource allocation, and behaviour change required for implementation
- **Competing priorities in existing systems**: Systematic recommendations compete with other urgent demands on people's time, attention, and resources, requiring strategic thinking about timing and positioning
- **Change resistance from established patterns**: Current approaches persist not because they're optimal, but because they're familiar, embedded in existing systems, and changing them requires coordinated effort across multiple people
- **Impact measurement ambiguity**: Difficult to distinguish between research quality and implementation effectiveness, making it unclear whether lack of change reflects analytical limitations or systems challenges
- **Stakeholder buy-in requirements**: Others must understand, trust, and commit to changes based on research they didn't conduct, requiring communication and relationship-building beyond analytical capabilities
- **Resource and authority constraints**: Individual researchers lack formal power to implement organisational, community, or system changes even when analysis clearly identifies beneficial approaches

These represent the same fundamental challenge: bridging the gap between systematic understanding and coordinated action that benefits others, when impact requires influencing people, systems, and processes beyond individual control through approaches that extend significantly beyond research and analysis capabilities.

### Promise and pay-off

After this chapter you will be able to design approaches that transform individual learning into collective benefit, evaluate whether your systematic thinking is creating meaningful change for others through both quantitative and qualitative measures, and recognise when your research and analysis capabilities can contribute to important challenges versus when other types of expertise and intervention are needed.

## 3. The scholar's toolkit: systematic impact design

**The historical pattern**

Sarah's challenge—translating her systematic workflow analysis into organisational changes that actually improve employees' daily experiences—reflects a pattern scholars have faced across centuries: how to transform understanding into beneficial action when implementation requires navigating complex social, political, and practical realities beyond individual control.

Ancient scholars in China developed approaches that explicitly connected theoretical understanding to practical governance, recognising that insights meant nothing unless they could improve actual policy outcomes. Confucian scholars didn't just develop philosophical frameworks—they designed specific methods for translating moral and social insights into administrative practices that could be implemented across diverse regional contexts. They learned that impact required understanding both the principles and the messy realities of implementation.

Medieval Islamic scholars faced similar challenges when mathematical and scientific insights needed to become useful technologies, medical treatments, and engineering solutions. Figures like Al-Jazari didn't just understand mechanical principles—they developed systematic approaches to designing devices that would work in real-world conditions with available materials and local craftsmen's skills. They discovered that moving from understanding to impact required designing solutions that accounted for implementation constraints rather than assuming perfect conditions.

During the Enlightenment, scholars like Benjamin Franklin exemplified approaches that systematically connected research to practical benefit. Franklin didn't just study electricity—he designed methods for translating scientific insights into inventions that improved people's lives, civic institutions that enhanced community decision-making, and political innovations that could be implemented within existing governmental systems. His approach recognised that scholarly impact required designing interventions that worked within social and political realities rather than hoping that good ideas would implement themselves.

Modern scholars facing contemporary implementation challenges—from public health researchers trying to influence policy during health crises to climate scientists working to promote environmental action—developed systematic approaches to what academics now call "knowledge mobilisation" and "translational research." They learned that creating real-world impact required designing collaborative relationships with implementers, understanding stakeholder perspectives and constraints, and building interventions that could adapt to local contexts while maintaining core effectiveness.

**The core principle: systematic impact design**

Rather than hoping that solid research automatically creates beneficial change, effective scholars approach impact as a systematic design challenge that requires understanding both the insights and the implementation environment. Systematic impact design involves deliberately planning how understanding can become actionable within existing social, organisational, and political systems, building relationships with people who can implement changes, and creating approaches that work within real-world constraints while maintaining the integrity of the underlying insights.

**The scholarly toolkit**

This principle led scholars to develop specific impact approaches that transfer directly to modern contexts where individuals want their systematic thinking to benefit others:

- **Understanding the implementation landscape**: Systematically researching not just problems and solutions, but the practical constraints, stakeholder priorities, and system dynamics that will affect whether change can actually happen
- **Building coalitions around shared understanding**: Creating collaborative relationships with people who share concerns about the problem and have complementary capabilities needed for implementation
- **Designing interventions that account for real-world messiness**: Developing approaches that can work within existing constraints rather than requiring perfect conditions, while maintaining the effectiveness of core insights
- **Creating feedback systems for learning and adaptation**: Establishing methods for evaluating whether interventions are actually improving outcomes and adjusting approaches based on implementation experience
- **Scaling impact through knowledge sharing**: Developing systematic approaches to helping others understand and apply insights in their own contexts rather than trying to solve every instance of a problem individually

These tools address exactly what modern systematic thinkers face: the need to translate individual understanding into beneficial change that works within complex social and organisational realities, while recognising that impact requires capabilities beyond research and analysis alone.

## 4. Systematic impact design in practice

Effective change makers follow the principle of **systematic impact design** across three levels:

- **Principle** (strategic): Deliberately planning how understanding can become actionable within existing social and organisational systems
- **Tools** (operational): Specific methods for translating insights into beneficial change that works within real-world constraints
- **Tactics** (implementation): Concrete steps for using each tool in your specific context and challenges

You don't need all tools simultaneously, but choosing 1-2 that address your biggest impact challenges makes an immediate difference to how effectively your systematic thinking benefits others.

**Rules of thumb for systematic impact design:**

- Research the implementation environment as thoroughly as you researched the original problem
- Start with people who already care about the issue rather than trying to convince skeptics
- Design changes that work within existing constraints rather than requiring perfect conditions
- Measure what actually improves for people, not just whether your recommendations were adopted
- Focus on helping others succeed with your insights rather than getting credit for solutions

### Research who can actually make change happen

When Tom wanted his sustainability analysis to benefit his community, he initially focused on perfecting his environmental research and creating compelling presentations about energy savings. But his recommendations went nowhere until he systematically researched the implementation landscape: Who makes decisions about community programmes? What budget cycles and approval processes exist? Which residents have successfully organised community initiatives before? Once he understood that the residents association controlled small grant funds, that the local council had a sustainability officer looking for community partnerships, and that three neighbours had experience organising collective action, he could design approaches that worked within existing decision-making systems rather than hoping good analysis would create change automatically.

_How to use this tool:_

- **Map the decision-makers and influencers** who would need to support change for your insights to benefit others
- **Understand existing processes and constraints** that affect when and how change can happen in your context (budget cycles, approval processes, competing priorities)
- **Identify people with implementation experience** who have successfully created similar changes and could provide guidance about practical realities
- **Research successful examples** of comparable changes in similar contexts to understand what approaches have worked

_When this goes wrong:_ People either skip implementation research entirely (assuming good analysis is sufficient) or get overwhelmed by complexity and abandon impact efforts. Recovery: Focus on understanding the 2-3 most important constraints and decision-makers rather than mapping every possible factor.

### Find others who share your concerns

Sarah's workflow recommendations gained traction when she stopped presenting them as individual insights and started building coalitions with colleagues who were equally frustrated by the current systems. Instead of trying to convince leadership through analysis alone, she identified three department heads who were already struggling with the same productivity issues, two IT staff members who understood the technical constraints, and the office manager who dealt with daily operational problems. This group could advocate collectively for changes while bringing different types of expertise to implementation planning. The shared understanding created by multiple perspectives made the case for change much stronger than Sarah's individual research, however thorough.

_How to use this tool:_

- **Identify people who experience the same problems** your research addresses, even if they haven't conducted similar analysis
- **Connect with others who have complementary expertise** needed for implementation (technical skills, organisational authority, resource access, communication capabilities)
- **Share your research in ways that help others articulate their own concerns** rather than asking them to accept your conclusions
- **Create opportunities for collaborative problem-solving** where multiple perspectives can strengthen both understanding and implementation approaches

_When this goes wrong:_ People either try to build coalitions too broadly (losing focus) or only seek others who completely agree with their analysis (missing implementation expertise). Recovery: Focus on finding people who share concerns about the problem rather than requiring agreement with your specific solutions.

---

### Design changes that work within current reality

Maya's accessibility recommendations succeeded when she stopped proposing comprehensive redesigns and started identifying specific improvements that could be implemented within existing development cycles and budget constraints. Instead of requesting major product overhauls, she proposed accessibility fixes that could be integrated into planned feature updates, worked with engineering to identify solutions that wouldn't delay other projects, and connected accessibility improvements to business metrics the product team already cared about. Her systematic understanding of accessibility barriers remained intact, but she designed interventions that accounted for organisational realities rather than assuming ideal implementation conditions.

_How to use this tool:_

- **Break larger changes into smaller steps** that can be implemented within existing resource and time constraints
- **Connect your recommendations to goals and metrics** that decision-makers already prioritise rather than requiring them to adopt new priorities
- **Design pilot approaches** that allow testing changes on small scales before requiring major commitments
- **Account for practical constraints** like budget cycles, staff workloads, competing priorities, and organisational processes in your implementation design

_When this goes wrong:_ People either compromise so much that changes become ineffective (losing the value of systematic analysis) or remain inflexible about implementation approaches (preventing any progress). Recovery: Identify the core insights that must be preserved while remaining flexible about specific implementation methods.

---

### Create ways to learn whether change is actually helping

David's teaching methodology insights began creating real impact when he established systematic methods for evaluating whether his evidence-based approaches were actually improving student experiences. Rather than assuming that implementing research-backed teaching methods would automatically enhance learning, he created feedback systems: regular student surveys about engagement and comprehension, peer observations from other teachers, and tracking of specific learning outcomes over time. This allowed him to adapt his approaches based on what was actually working in his classroom context rather than relying on research findings from other educational environments. The feedback systems also provided evidence that convinced colleagues and administrators to consider similar approaches.

_How to use this tool:_

- **Define specific outcomes** that would indicate whether your insights are actually benefiting others (not just whether your recommendations were adopted)
- **Establish regular feedback collection** from people who are supposed to benefit from changes, using their perspectives to evaluate effectiveness
- **Track both quantitative measures** (completion rates, efficiency metrics, satisfaction scores) and qualitative indicators (user experiences, implementation challenges, unexpected benefits)
- **Create adjustment mechanisms** that allow modifying approaches based on implementation learning rather than assuming initial designs will work perfectly

_When this goes wrong:_ People either never evaluate actual outcomes (assuming implementation equals success) or become obsessed with measurement instead of using feedback to improve approaches. Recovery: Choose 2-3 key indicators that genuinely matter to the people you're trying to help and use them to guide iterative improvement.

### Help others apply your insights in their contexts

Marcus discovered that his healthcare advocacy research could benefit other families facing similar medical challenges, but only if he could help them adapt his systematic approaches to their specific situations rather than providing generic recommendations. He created simple frameworks that other families could use to evaluate treatment options, research specialists, and advocate effectively within their healthcare systems. By focusing on helping others develop their own systematic capabilities rather than trying to solve every individual case, Marcus scaled the impact of his research far beyond his own family's situation while building a network of families who could support each other through similar challenges.

_How to use this tool:_

- **Document the systematic approaches** you used so others can apply similar methods in their own contexts
- **Create templates, checklists, or frameworks** that help others implement your insights without requiring them to repeat your entire research process
- **Share both your findings and your methods** so people can adapt approaches to their specific circumstances rather than just copying your conclusions
- **Build communities of practice** around shared challenges where people can support each other in applying systematic approaches

_When this goes wrong:_ People either try to solve every individual instance personally (limiting scale) or share approaches so abstractly that others can't implement them effectively. Recovery: Focus on helping 2-3 people succeed with your approaches, then use their experiences to refine your knowledge-sharing methods.

### 7-day implementation starter

Rather than trying to use all tools simultaneously, choose one that addresses your biggest impact challenge and spend a week building the habit:

_Days 1-2: Setup_

- Pick one tool that would most help you translate your systematic thinking into beneficial change for others
- Identify a specific insight or analysis you want to make more actionable
- Spend 30 minutes planning how you'll use your chosen tool differently than your current approach

_Days 3-5: Practice_

- Use your chosen tool daily, even if just for 15 minutes
- Focus on building systematic impact habits rather than perfect execution
- Notice what feels natural versus what requires conscious effort about designing for implementation

_Day 6: Review_

- Compare your impact approach this week to your previous methods
- Ask: What's working well? What feels difficult? How has your relationship to implementation changed?
- Adjust your approach based on what you've discovered about creating change in your context

_Day 7: Share_

- Explain your impact design approach to someone else who could benefit from similar methods
- This tests whether your approach is clear and helps others develop better impact capabilities
- Plan which tool you'll try next week or whether to deepen your current approach

### Common failure modes

**Analysis perfectionism**: Continuing research indefinitely instead of testing implementation approaches → set research deadlines and begin impact design with current understanding, improving through implementation experience.

**Coalition avoidance**: Trying to create change individually rather than building collaborative relationships → identify 2-3 people who share concerns about the problem and could contribute different expertise to solutions.

**Implementation idealism**: Designing approaches that require perfect conditions rather than working within existing constraints → test changes on small scales within current systems before requesting major modifications.

---

These five tools operationalise the principle of systematic impact design, transforming the overwhelming challenge of "How do I make my research matter to others?" into specific, actionable approaches. Rather than hoping that solid analysis automatically creates beneficial change, you now have methods for systematically translating understanding into impact: researching the implementation landscape, building coalitions around shared concerns, designing changes that work within real constraints, creating feedback systems for learning and adaptation, and scaling impact through knowledge sharing.

This systematic approach solves the chapter's opening challenge—how to turn knowledge into actionable change that actually matters to others. When you can design for implementation as systematically as you research problems, you transform individual understanding into collective benefit while recognising both the possibilities and limitations of scholarly impact in complex social systems.

## 5. The mission

### Real story

When Dr. Devi Sridhar found herself thrust into public health communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, she faced an impact challenge that would reshape how she thought about scholarly contribution beyond academic institutions. As a global health expert, she had spent years researching pandemic preparedness and policy responses, but suddenly needed her systematic understanding to benefit entire populations making urgent decisions about health, education, and economic trade-offs.

Rather than simply publishing academic papers or offering expert opinions, Sridhar applied systematic impact design principles. She researched the implementation landscape by understanding how different populations accessed health information, what sources they trusted, and what practical constraints affected their decision-making. She built coalitions with healthcare workers, educators, and community leaders who could help translate complex epidemiological insights into actionable guidance for their specific contexts. She designed communication approaches that worked within existing media systems and social networks rather than requiring people to become epidemiologists themselves.

Crucially, Sridhar created feedback systems that allowed her to learn whether her public engagement was actually helping people make better decisions. She tracked not just media appearances or social media engagement, but whether communities were using her frameworks to evaluate local policies, whether parents felt more confident about school decisions, and whether her systematic approaches were being adapted by others facing similar communication challenges in different contexts.

This approach solved Sridhar's immediate challenge of contributing meaningful expertise during a public health crisis. But she recognised that the systematic impact design methods she'd developed could benefit other researchers facing similar challenges when their work needed to contribute to urgent social problems. Rather than keeping her approach confined to global health expertise, she began sharing frameworks that other scholars could use to translate their systematic understanding into beneficial change within their communities and professional contexts.

The broader impact exceeded anything Sridhar could have achieved through traditional academic publication alone. Her systematic approaches to impact design influenced how academic institutions support researchers engaging with policy and public challenges. Other scholars adopted her methods for building coalitions across expertise boundaries and designing interventions that work within existing social and political systems. Her frameworks contributed to broader conversations about how scholarly expertise can contribute constructively to democratic decision-making rather than creating expert-versus-public tensions.

What started as one researcher's systematic approach to pandemic communication became a model that improved how entire academic communities contribute to social challenges. Sridhar's willingness to design for implementation as systematically as she researched problems created impact approaches that continue to help scholars translate individual expertise into collective benefit during complex social challenges.

### Mission connection

The systematic impact design skills you've developed through this chapter don't just help you make your own research more useful—they prepare you to contribute meaningfully to the complex challenges facing your community and society.

When you can research implementation landscapes, build coalitions around shared concerns, design changes that work within real constraints, create feedback systems for learning, and scale impact through knowledge sharing, you become someone who can help transform how groups approach social problem-solving. Your family, workplace, and community benefit when you can facilitate approaches that translate understanding into beneficial change rather than leaving systematic insights trapped in individual analysis.

This impact capability is essential for the broader mission of democratising scholarly tools. Complex social challenges—from climate adaptation to education equity to healthcare accessibility—require more people capable of systematic impact design, not fewer. When citizens can translate their research about local issues into collaborative action, when workers can transform workplace analysis into organisational improvements, when community members can convert systematic understanding into collective benefit, social problem-solving capacity increases across society.

The tools you've learned—researching implementation contexts, building collaborative relationships, designing for real-world constraints, creating feedback systems, and scaling through knowledge sharing—represent exactly the kind of systematic thinking that enables meaningful participation in important social challenges. You're now equipped not just to make your own insights more actionable, but to help others develop the impact design skills that turn individual learning into collective progress.

When more people can systematically design for impact, we create conditions for more effective social problem-solving, stronger democratic participation, and more resilient communities that can adapt collaboratively to complex challenges. The systematic approaches that help you contribute to problems you care about, when practiced by many people across different contexts, become the foundation for a society that can translate collective intelligence into beneficial change.

Your systematic impact design contributes to a world where scholarly tools serve social benefit rather than remaining confined to individual improvement or academic recognition—exactly the democratised scholarship this book envisions.
