## About me
<img src="Media/Michael-Rowe-profile.png" alt="Michael Rowe" style="float: left; width: 191px; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 5px;" />I am an Associate Professor and Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of Health and Care Sciences at the University of Lincoln in the United Kingdom.

My scholarship focuses on the transformative potential of digital technologies in education, with a particular interest in how they influence relationships between teachers and students in learning environments. Drawing on critical pedagogy and complexity science, my work focuses on the use of technological innovation to enhance both education and practice while maintaining student-centred approaches to learning.

## About this project

This site explores **emergent scholarship**—a framework for scholarly engagement that emphasises connection, adaptation, and ecological sustainability in knowledge work.

Rather than treating knowledge as a static commodity, emergent scholarship recognises that understanding develops through relationships, networks, and dynamic interactions within complex systems. This approach is particularly relevant in our current era of rapid technological change, information abundance, and interconnected global challenges.

## Purpose

This digital space serves as:

- A **knowledge garden** where ideas grow, connect, and evolve over time
- A **laboratory** for experimenting with networked thinking and non-linear scholarship
- A **conversation starter** for engaging with others interested in how we create, share, and apply knowledge

The content here reflects ongoing learning and thinking-in-progress. You'll find notes, essays, reflections, and syntheses that represent different stages of development rather than polished final products.

## This site

This site is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), an open-source static site generator designed for publishing digital gardens and interconnected notes. The content is written in Markdown and published as an evolving collection of linked thoughts.
