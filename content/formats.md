Content on this site is structured into distinct formats, each with a different purpose, scope, and level of development.

<i class="ph ph-pencil-simple"></i> **Post** — Short-form commentary and thinking in progress. Posts respond to ideas, raise questions, and develop arguments that may later become essays.

<i class="ph ph-file-text"></i> **Essay** — Structured academic argument with an abstract, citations, and a version number that tracks progress toward formal publication.

<i class="ph ph-note"></i> **Note** — An atomic concept definition. Notes are brief and precise — a working glossary of ideas and frameworks used across the site.

<i class="ph ph-presentation"></i> **Presentation** — Slide decks and talks from conferences and workshops, embedded here with context and links to related work.

<i class="ph ph-graduation-cap"></i> **Course** — A structured, multi-lesson programme for developing a practical skill or working through a complex topic systematically.
