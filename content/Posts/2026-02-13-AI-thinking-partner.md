> [!info] Beyond generation
> The most valuable thing AI did during this writing process wasn't producing text. It was asking questions I hadn't thought to ask myself, and being wrong in ways that clarified what I actually meant. Using AI as a thinking partner isn't about getting it to agree with you; it's about exploring disagreement and tensions in productive ways.

I have [[2026-02-11-building-AI-collaboration-workflow|written before]] about building an AI collaboration workflow—using Claude Code to restructure my Obsidian vaults through structured documentation and iterative refinement. That post describes the *architecture* layer of working with AI: building the context that makes collaboration reliable. The human contribution in that process is judgement about whether the output matches your vision.

This post describes something different: what it looks like to use AI as a writing partner when the work is intellectual rather than operational. Over the past week, I have been working with Claude to revise an academic paper—a theoretical framework for integrating AI into health professions education. The paper draws on four learning theories, conducts a structured conceptual analysis, and derives design principles. I had been developing it for a year and had published an early preprint. But I knew it needed serious revision before journal submission, and I could no longer see its problems clearly.

What followed wasn't a writing exercise. It was a thinking exercise, and it changed the paper in ways I hadn't anticipated.

## Why critique matters more than generation

I asked Claude for an honest assessment of the draft. It responded as a good colleague would: pinpointing what worked and what didn't with enough specificity to be useful.

Some of the feedback confirmed existing suspicions. The methodology section claimed to be "thematic synthesis" when it was actually a structured conceptual analysis—a distinction that matters for peer review. The theoretical foundations were thorough but too long for the work they were doing; an academic audience does not need extended summaries of Vygotsky or Freire.

Other feedback surfaced problems I had missed. The paper was originally structured around an acronym—ACADEMIC—built from seven principles. Claude was direct: two of the seven principles felt forced, "pulled into existence to complete the acronym" rather than emerging from the analysis. It identified five strong convergences across the theories and two that were merely implications. This was uncomfortable because it was obviously true. I had been talked into the acronym by the prevailing wisdom that you need to "brand" scholarly output. Letting go of it freed the principles to be what they actually were.

## Experience as theoretical sensitivity

The most productive exchange addressed a quiet concern: the problem of prior beliefs. The paper analyses four learning theories to identify themes which then become design principles. But I have fifteen years of experience teaching and researching technology in professional education. I already had a strong sense of what "good" technology-enhanced education looks like. Had I simply driven the results toward conclusions I had already reached?

When I raised this, Claude reframed it. What I was describing wasn't a methodological flaw but *theoretical sensitivity*—a concept from grounded theory. Deep domain knowledge is what enables a researcher to recognise meaningful patterns rather than superficial ones. The problem only arises if you pretend the analysis was purely inductive when it was actually shaped by informed judgement. The solution is not to hide the prior beliefs but to own them through a positionality statement that acknowledges the commitments, explains how they shaped the analysis, and lets the reader evaluate accordingly.

This reframing changed how I understood the work. I went from seeing my experience as something to apologise for to recognising it as the reason the analysis had any credibility. That shift came from the exchange, not from something I would have reached alone.

## Sharpening arguments through pushback

Not every suggestion was right, and the moments where I pushed back were as productive as the moments where I agreed.

Claude recommended reducing the principles from seven to five for the sake of parsimony. On two principles—emergent curriculum design and interprofessional community knowledge building—I agreed. The first was downstream of other principles; the second was forced to fit "interprofessional" when the analysis pointed to something broader.

But I wanted to keep a principle around *networked knowledge building*—the idea that the most important problems we face are wicked problems requiring collaboration across disciplinary and epistemological boundaries, and that AI agents are now part of those networks. Claude's response was useful: while the theoretical support was genuine, the *wicked problems* framing worked better as a discussion-level argument than as an emergent finding. I kept the principle but repositioned the justification. The paper is stronger for the distinction.

I was pushed to think more carefully about my positions throughout this process. When Claude suggested a framing and I disagreed, I had to articulate *why*. This sharpened the argument more than the original suggestion would have. The discipline of explaining my reasoning to something that would engage substantively—rather than just nodding—was genuinely useful.

## Voice as a test of meaning

After the structural revisions, I asked Claude to apply my writing voice to the draft. I used a style persona (a description of my analytical patterns and sentence-level habits) to see what the paper sounded like in my register rather than in generic academic prose.

Reading the output, I wasn't asking "is this correct?" but "does this sound like me?" and, more precisely, "does this say what I mean?" Some transformations landed immediately. The abstract's opening—reframed to lead with the problem AI has exposed rather than a methodological summary—felt right. The positionality section's directness captured what I had been trying to say more clearly.

Other moves required adjustment. The voice persona emphasises analytical commitment, and in places Claude had pushed that commitment too far, taking positions more starkly than the evidence warranted. These moments were informative and showed me the line between confident directness and the overreach I needed to avoid.

## The necessity of asymmetry

This was not a conversation between equals. Claude has no stakes in the paper's argument. It has no career, no reputation, and no discomfort when a structural decision is challenged. The asymmetry is real.

But collaboration does not require symmetry. It requires that the exchange changes the thinking. The paper that emerged is substantially different from what I would have produced alone, not because Claude wrote better prose, but because the iterative exchange of analysis, challenge, and refinement pushed my thinking into territory I had not explored.

The prior beliefs reframing, the decision to drop the acronym, and the distinction between analysis and discussion were not ideas I brought to the process. They emerged from it.

## From architecture to argument

My [[2026-02-11-building-AI-collaboration-workflow|earlier post]] described the architecture layer of AI collaboration; building structured documentation to make sessions more effective. That work follows a try-evaluate-lock cycle where the human contribution is taste and [[taste-and-judgement|evaluative judgement]] about whether the output matches a vision.

The experience I'm describing here operates at a different level. The question isn't "does this output match my vision?" but "is my vision sound?" When your analytical positions are challenged—when a partner points out that your methodology cannot survive the scrutiny you are claiming for it—the judgement required isn't whether the output is right. It is whether *you* are right.

That is what makes this a genuine collaboration: not the quality of the text, but the quality of the challenge.
