title: AI as thinking partner in academic writing
type: post
description: Most discussions of AI in writing focus on generation — producing drafts, summarising sources, polishing prose. This post describes a different experience. Working with Claude to revise an academic paper, I found the most valuable contribution wasn't what it wrote but what it challenged me to think through. The process pushed me to defend my analytical choices, reconsider structural decisions I'd grown attached to, and articulate positions I'd previously left implicit. It felt like collaboration in a fundamental sense — not because the AI produced good text, but because the exchange changed my thinking.

I've [[building-ai-collaboration-workflow|written before]] about building an AI collaboration workflow — using Claude Code to restructure my Obsidian vaults through structured documentation, processing rules, and iterative refinement. That post describes the *architecture* layer of working with AI: building the context that makes collaboration reliable and consistent. The human contribution in that process is judgement about whether the output matches your vision.

This post describes something different. Over the past few days I've been working with Claude to revise an academic paper — a theoretical framework for integrating AI into health professions education. The paper draws on four learning theories, conducts a structured conceptual analysis, and derives a set of design principles. I'd been developing it for nearly a year and had published an early preprint. But I knew it needed serious revision before journal submission, and I wasn't sure I could see its problems clearly anymore.

What happened next wasn't a writing exercise. It was a thinking exercise — and it changed the paper in ways I hadn't anticipated.

## Starting with honest critique

I asked Claude to analyse the draft and give me its assessment. It did what a good colleague would do: it told me what was working and what wasn't, with enough specificity to be useful.

Some of the feedback confirmed things I already suspected. The methodology section was calling itself "thematic synthesis" when it was actually closer to structured conceptual analysis — a distinction that matters if the paper is going to survive peer review. The theoretical foundations were thorough but too long for the argumentative work they were doing; a serious academic audience doesn't need extended summaries of Vygotsky and Freire.

But other feedback surfaced problems I hadn't seen. The paper had originally been structured around an acronym — ACADEMIC — built from the first letters of seven principles. Claude told me directly that two of the seven principles felt forced, that they'd been "pulled into existence to complete the acronym" rather than emerging genuinely from the analysis. It identified five strong convergences across the theories and two that were more like implications than findings. This was uncomfortable to hear because it was obviously true. I'd been talked into the acronym by the prevailing wisdom that you need to "brand" your scholarly output. Letting go of it freed the principles to be what they actually were.

## The prior beliefs problem

The most productive exchange concerned something I'd been quietly worried about. The paper analyses four learning theories through a structured lens to identify convergent themes, which then become design principles. But I have fifteen years of experience teaching and researching technology in professional education. I already had a strong sense of what "good" technology-enhanced education looks like before I began the analysis. Had I simply driven the results toward conclusions I'd already reached?

When I raised this, Claude reframed it in a way I hadn't considered. What I was describing wasn't a methodological flaw — it was theoretical sensitivity, a concept from grounded theory methodology. Deep domain knowledge is what enables a researcher to recognise meaningful patterns rather than superficial ones. The problem only arises if you pretend the analysis was purely inductive when it was actually shaped by informed judgement. The solution isn't to hide the prior beliefs but to own them — through a positionality statement that acknowledges the commitments, explains how they shaped the analysis, and lets the reader evaluate accordingly.

This reframing didn't just solve a technical problem in the paper. It changed how I understood what I'd done. I went from seeing my experience as something to apologise for to recognising it as the reason the analysis had any credibility in the first place. That shift came from the exchange, not from something I'd have reached on my own.

## Pushing back

Not everything Claude suggested was right, and the moments where I pushed back were as productive as the moments where I agreed.

Claude recommended reducing the principles from seven to five, arguing that parsimony would strengthen the paper. On two of the seven — emergent curriculum design and interprofessional community knowledge building — I agreed. The first was downstream of other principles rather than a distinct convergence. The second was forced to fit "interprofessional" when the analysis actually pointed to something broader.

But I wanted to keep a principle around *networked knowledge building* — the idea that the most important problems we face are wicked problems requiring collaboration across disciplinary, institutional, and epistemological boundaries, and that AI agents are increasingly part of those networks. Claude's response was useful: the theoretical support for this was genuine (connectivism, communities of practice, complexity theory's emphasis on interconnection), but the *wicked problems* framing worked better as a discussion-level argument than as something that emerged from the matrix analysis. So I kept the principle but repositioned the justification. The paper is stronger for the distinction.

I felt pushed to think more carefully about my positions throughout this process — but I also felt confident enough in what I wanted to say that I didn't simply accept the output. When Claude suggested a particular framing and I disagreed, I had to articulate *why* I disagreed, which often sharpened the argument more than the original suggestion would have. The discipline of explaining my reasoning to something that would engage with it substantively — rather than just nodding — was genuinely useful.

## Voice and ownership

After the structural and argumentative revisions were complete, I asked Claude to apply my writing voice to the draft. I'd developed a style persona document — a description of my analytical patterns, sentence-level habits, and characteristic moves — and I wanted to see what the paper sounded like when written in my register rather than in competent-but-generic academic prose.

Reading the output, I wasn't asking "is this correct?" but "does this sound like me?" and, more precisely, "does this say what I mean?" Some of the voice transformations landed immediately. The abstract's opening — reframed to lead with the problem AI has exposed rather than a methodological summary — felt right in a way the original didn't. The positionality section's directness ("I should be direct about what I brought to this analysis") captured something I'd been trying to say more carefully than was useful.

Other moves required adjustment. The voice persona emphasises analytical commitment, and in places Claude had pushed that commitment further than I'd go — taking positions more starkly than the evidence warranted. Those moments were informative. They showed me where the line sits between the confident directness I want and the overreach I need to avoid.

## What this isn't

This was not a conversation between equals. Claude doesn't have stakes in the paper's argument. It doesn't have a career that depends on the claims landing well, or a professional reputation shaped by fifteen years of thinking about these problems. It doesn't experience the discomfort of having a structural decision challenged, or the satisfaction of finding a better framing. The asymmetry is real.

But collaboration doesn't require symmetry. What it requires is that the exchange changes the thinking — and the paper that emerged is substantially different from what I would have produced alone. Not because Claude wrote better prose, but because the iterative exchange of analysis, challenge, response, and refinement pushed my thinking into territory I hadn't explored on my own.

The prior beliefs reframing. The decision to drop the acronym. The distinction between what emerges from an analysis and what belongs in a discussion. The recognition that five well-grounded principles carry more weight than seven that include passengers. None of these were ideas I brought to the process. They emerged from it.

## Architecture and argument

My [[building-ai-collaboration-workflow|earlier post]] described the architecture layer of AI collaboration — building structured documentation that makes each session more effective. That kind of work follows a try-evaluate-lock cycle: you test an approach, judge the output against your vision, and codify what works. The human contribution is taste and [[taste-and-judgement|evaluative judgement]] about whether each iteration moves closer to what you're building.

The experience I'm describing here operates at a different level. The question isn't "does this output match my vision?" but "is my vision actually sound?" When your analytical positions are challenged — when someone points out that your methodology can't survive the scrutiny you're claiming for it, or that your principles include two passengers — the judgement required isn't whether the output is right. It's whether *you* are right. And sometimes the answer is that you're not, or that you're right about the destination but wrong about the route.

That's what made this feel like a genuine collaboration. Not the quality of the text, but the quality of the challenge.
