While academics probably have more autonomy around structuring their days than many other employees, few feel as if they have any control at all, often spending their days reacting to a rising tide of demands for their attention. The aim of this course on time management for academics is to learn how to manage your time as a first step towards working to a fixed daily schedule with protected time to focus on the work you care about.

A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days…it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time.

Annie Dillard (2013)

There's no time to breathe when you're running all the time. When your working day feels beyond your control, it's hard to pay attention to anything other than what's in front of you. We feel like we're working all the time, and that we bounce around between tasks without any focus. We get to the end of the week feeling like we've made no progress on our most important work, only to look ahead at the next week with the same sense of dread.

Much of the anxiety associated with academic work stems from a feeling that your schedule is out of your control; that you have no autonomy in planning your day. The purpose of this course is to help you establish a space in your schedule to pause, reflect, and build a system of habits and routines for calm productivity.
