Lesson overview

Objective: Define the different types of tasks in your working context

Summary: Not all tasks deserve equal time or attention in your schedule. By thoughtfully categorising your academic work into high-value, important, and routine tasks, you can protect your peak cognitive hours (3-4 hours daily) for the deep, meaningful work that really matters. Everything else – like email, marking, and administrative work – can be batched into lower-energy periods.

Key habits:

Identify and protect 2-3 blocks of focused time (1.5-2 hours each) daily for high-value work

Schedule routine tasks during lower-energy periods of your day

Batch similar administrative tasks together rather than handling them as they arise

Review and adjust your task categories weekly to ensure you're spending time on what matters most

Stop treating your to-do list as one undifferentiated mass of tasks. Be strategic about what you do when, and you'll create the head space needed to make real progress on work that matters.

Introduction

An undifferentiated to-do list can very quickly become overwhelming. It's all very well to use lists of tasks to track your work, but when you create an undifferentiated to do list it can quickly become overwhelming. In these situations you may find that you tend to work on the small, easily completed tasks. They're quick wins where you feel as if you're making progress. But, you're really filling your day with an activity that Oliver Burkeman calls 'clearing the decks'. The problem with this approach is that there are always more incoming tasks, which is why you get to the end of the month having made very little progress on the big, high-value projects, even though you feel like you're always working. The reality is that you'll never clear the decks to make space for the work you want to do.

I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities...batched into smaller bursts... Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration...can produce a lot of valuable output.

Cal Newport

Different plans for different tasks

You need to recognise the different types of tasks in your workload, which allows you to prioritise them. This in turn enables you to allocate the high-value tasks to your most productive hours in the day.

For example, high-value tasks (like writing and publishing) have a high return per unit of time invested. Important tasks (giving feedback on a report, for example) need doing, but may have little strategic value and are typically not urgent. Urgent tasks need to be done immediately, or at least very soon, but may not be important. Tasks that can be completed in 2 minutes or less can be done immediately (or, they can be batched into an allocated period of time; see the lesson on Time-blocking). Some tasks can be delegated. Some can be postponed. Some can be ignored. An example of a framework for managing different types of tasks is the Eisenhower matrix (see the image on the right).

The aim is that you start categorising the tasks in your list so that you can more effectively schedule them.

Knowing what kind of task you're dealing with can give you some insight into how it needs to be managed.

When you understand which of your tasks have the highest return on investment, it becomes easier to allocate time to them.

This means that you can protect the most productive 3-4 hours of your day on deep work, rather than whittle that time away on routine work like email and meetings.

By thoughtfully categorising your tasks and allocating them to appropriate time slots, you're creating the head space needed to approach your most meaningful work with clarity and focus. When you're not constantly switching between different types of tasks - each requiring different levels of cognitive energy - you reduce the mental overhead that contributes to feeling overwhelmed.

This approach helps establish a more sustainable rhythm to your academic work, where you can make consistent progress on high-value projects while still handling the necessary day-to-day responsibilities of academic life. The key is to work with your natural energy patterns rather than against them, creating pockets of calm productivity rather than trying to maintain constant output throughout the day.

Practical examples

Each of the examples below demonstrates a process for managing different types of tasks. These examples demonstrate how different academics at different career stages can adapt task classification principles to their unique contexts. The key isn't to perfectly replicate any one approach, but to thoughtfully analyse your own workload and create routines that protect time for meaningful work.

High-value tasks:

Writing first grant proposal

Developing two research papers from PhD

Creating teaching materials for a new module

Important but not urgent:

Reviewing department teaching materials

Contributing to curriculum review

Attending faculty development workshops

Routine tasks:

Responding to student emails

Weekly team meetings

Administrative paperwork

Applying task classification to the tasks above:

Use Friday mornings for strategic planning

Block 7-9am for writing before campus gets busy

Batch student emails into two daily slots

Schedule meetings in the afternoon when energy is lower

High-value tasks:

Supervising 4 postgraduate students

Leading a major research project

Writing an impact case study

Important but not urgent:

Peer-reviewing papers

Committee work

Mentoring junior colleagues

Routine tasks:

Module coordination

Marking assignments

Department meetings

Applying task classification to the tasks above:

Use short gaps between meetings for quick task

Protect Tuesday and Thursday mornings for PhD supervision

Block Wednesdays for focused writing

Batch routine admin into Monday afternoons

High-value tasks:

Strategic department planning

Writing major funding bids

Maintaining key research collaborations

Important but not urgent:

Staff development reviews

Budget planning

Policy development

Routine tasks:

Responding to emails

Attending university meetings

Signing off on administrative requests

Applying task classification to the tasks above:

Schedule "office hours" for staff queries

Book 2-hour blocks three mornings a week for strategic work

Delegate routine admin where possible

Use early mornings for focused writing

Whether you're writing grant proposals, supervising students, or leading a department, categorising tasks by their value and matching them to your energy levels helps create the head space needed for deep, focused work. Start small – perhaps by protecting just one high-value time block – and gradually build a system that works for you.

Pause and reflect

Sometimes protecting time for high-value work can feel uncomfortable, as if you're putting your own career development ahead of departmental needs. However, this perspective misses two key points. First, you're still allocating significant blocks of time to important tasks - emails, meetings, feedback - just during periods better suited to their cognitive demands. Second, your high-value work directly serves your institution's mission. When you write that grant proposal or develop innovative teaching materials, you're not just advancing your career; you're contributing to your department's success.

Think of task classification as a tool for creating clarity and focus. When you know you have protected time for important work, you can engage more fully with other tasks during their allocated times, reducing the mental overhead of constant context switching.

Activity

This activity uses time-blocking alongside task categorisation. Time-blocking is covered in more detail in the next lesson.

Schedule deep work blocks

Look at next week's calendar and identify 2-3 potential blocks of uninterrupted time (aim for 2 hours each, but start with 1 if needed)

If your calendar is already full, look for meetings that could be shortened or rescheduled

Begin with protecting just one block if that feels more manageable - we're building sustainable habits, not adding pressure

Remember: start by scheduling deep work, rather than trying to find time for it after other commitments

Match tasks to blocks

Choose one high-value task that will make meaningful progress in your work (writing, new programme development, research planning)

Allocate this task to your protected time blocks

Avoid assigning routine tasks like marking or email to these periods

Consider your natural energy patterns when choosing the timing of your blocks

Prepare for success

Identify a physical space where you can work without interruption

Plan what you'll need for your deep work session

Decide how you'll handle potential interruptions

Set up any necessary boundaries (auto-email replies, door signs, communication with colleagues)

Key takeaways

Not all tasks are created equal. An undifferentiated to-do list can lead to spending time on quick, easy tasks while neglecting the high-value work that moves your career forward. It's crucial to categorise different types of tasks (high-value, important, urgent, etc.) to manage them effectively.

Protect your peak cognitive hours. The most productive 3-4 hours of your day should be reserved for deep, high-value work. Routine tasks should be batched and scheduled during lower-energy periods.

Start by creating space for deep work. Rather than trying to fit important work around other commitments, begin by blocking out substantial chunks of time (ideally 2-hour blocks) for focused work. Start with this as your foundation and work other tasks around it, instead of letting your schedule fill up with smaller tasks first.
