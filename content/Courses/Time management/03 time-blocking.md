Lesson overview

Objective: Allocate tasks to specific blocks of time in your schedule

Summary: Time-blocking is about taking control of your day before it controls you. By deliberately allocating blocks of time to specific tasks, you create protective boundaries around your high-value work. It's about making intentional choices that help you maintain focus on what matters to you while building in flexibility for the natural variations of academic life. When implemented thoughtfully, time-blocking becomes less about rigid time management and more about creating the conditions where meaningful work can flourish. Remember, you need to deliberately block out time for your priority tasks before other people's priorities take over your schedule.

Key habits:

Start each day or week by identifying your highest-value work and blocking out protected time for it before other commitments can claim that space

Batch similar tasks together (like email, admin work, or student consultations) to reduce context-switching and maintain deeper focus during important work blocks

Build in buffer time between blocks (15-30 minutes) to accommodate tasks that run long, handle unexpected issues, and maintain sustainable energy levels throughout the day

Review and adjust your blocks weekly, noting what worked well and what needs to change, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to emerging priorities without abandoning your core protected time

Introduction

No-one is going to create time in your schedule for you to do the deep work that will move your career forward. Starting your day without a plan typically means that you start your day with email, which probably isn't going to help you move your meaningful work forward. Alternatively, you start your day by reacting to whoever gets to your office first with tasks that require your attention. Usually, these tasks are not high-value for you. And, even if you do manage to start working on a piece of writing, for example, frequent interruptions mean that you're always context-switching, paying a cognitive price every time this happens.

I only write when inspiration strikes. Fortunately, it strikes at nine every morning.

Creating space for what matters

Time-blocking is a form of scheduling where different tasks and activities are allocated to specific blocks of time in your daily schedule. When you combine time-blocking with task-batching (grouping similar tasks together) you can avoid context-switching.

Time-blocking is the first step in moving from being reactive to proactive.

You decide up front what you're going to spend time on.

It forces you to make intentional choices about when you're going to focus on specific tasks.

Time-blocking forces you to pay attention to the work you need to do, the progress you make on that work, and how long you need to set aside to make that progress.

Time-blocking is a powerful first step in moving from a reactive to a proactive approach to your academic work. Rather than letting your days be dictated by your inbox or whoever reaches your office first, time-blocking helps you create the head space needed for meaningful academic work.

By deliberately allocating specific blocks of time to different tasks, you're not just organising your schedule – you're making an intentional commitment to the work that matters most. Time-blocking helps reduce the mental strain of constant context-switching, allowing you to maintain a sense of calm productivity even during busy periods.

Common myths about time-blocking

You may feel hesitant to try time-blocking because of persistent myths about what it means in practice. Some think that it requires scheduling every minute of the day into rigid blocks. Others worry it will make them less responsive to students and colleagues, or that it doesn't suit the unpredictable nature of academic life.

These misconceptions often prevent academics from trying this approach. So let's explore a few common myths about time-blocking.

MYTH

Time-blocking means every minute must be scheduled

REALITY

Effective time-blocking requires flexibility and breathing room. Think of time blocks as a framework, not a prison. Good time-blocking includes buffer zones for unexpected tasks, recovery periods, and spontaneous opportunities. Trying to schedule every minute leads to stress and eventual abandonment of the system.

Try this: Start by blocking only your most important work (2-3 blocks per day) and include at least 30 minutes of 'buffer time' between major blocks.

MYTH

I need long blocks of time to make writing progress

REALITY

Regular, shorter sessions often produce better results than irregular marathon sessions. Consistent 30-60 minute focused blocks build momentum and maintain connection with your work. Many prolific academic writers report that daily short sessions help them stay engaged with complex projects over time.

Try this: Schedule three 30-minute writing blocks across the week. Use the first 5 minutes to review where you left off, then write for 20 minutes, leaving 5 minutes to note where to pick up next time.

Flip Card

MYTH

Time-blocking is too rigid for academic life

REALITY

Time-blocking actually creates more flexibility by establishing clear boundaries around your important work. When you protect time for high-value tasks, you have more freedom to adjust other blocks as needed. The key is viewing your blocks as movable units rather than fixed commitments. Many academics find they have more control over their schedule once they start time-blocking.

Try this: Use a digital calendar for easy block adjustment, and review/adjust your blocks at the start of each week based on changing priorities.

MYTH

Time-blocking will prevent me from being responsive to students and colleagues

REALITY

By clearly defining when you're available and when you're focusing on deep work, you actually become more reliably responsive. Time-blocking helps you create dedicated spaces for different types of work, including student and colleague interaction. This structured approach often leads to higher quality interactions since you're fully present during designated meeting times.

Try this: Create clear 'office hours' blocks in your schedule and communicate these times to students and colleagues. Use an auto-responder during deep work blocks to let people know when you'll next be available.

Minimal viable time-blocking

The simplest way to start time-blocking is to protect just two important blocks each day:

Core principles of minimum viable time-blocking

One deep work block in the morning before the day gets away from you

One admin block to handle email and small tasks

Everything else can be flexible

Implementation steps

Block these times in your calendar as recurring meetings

Decide the day before what your deep work task will be

Protect the morning block fiercely - no email, no meetings

Use the admin block to stay on top of small tasks

Why this works

Small enough to feel achievable

Creates immediate positive impact

Builds confidence in the system

Establishes basic boundaries

Allows for flexibility in the rest of your day

Once this minimal version feels comfortable (usually after 2-3 weeks), you can gradually add more structure. But starting here gives you the core benefit of time-blocking without overwhelming your existing schedule.

Pause and reflect

Time-blocking works best when viewed as a flexible guide rather than a rigid set of rules. Your schedule will inevitably face disruptions – an urgent student matter, a last-minute meeting request, or simply tasks taking longer than expected. Rather than seeing these as failures of the system, treat them as natural variations in academic life. The key is to adapt your blocks while maintaining protective boundaries around your most important work.

This is also a good moment to notice if you're spending more time planning than doing. While time-blocking can help create structure in your day, it shouldn't become another source of administrative overhead. If you find yourself frequently adjusting blocks or obsessing over the perfect schedule, step back and simplify. Remember that the purpose of time-blocking is to create space for meaningful work, not to achieve scheduling perfection. Consider what's working well and what feels sustainable for your specific context.

Activity

Step 1: Map your fixed schedule

Review your weekly calendar

Note unmovable commitments (teaching, meetings, family responsibilities)

Mark these clearly in your calendar

Step 2: Identify your energy patterns

When are you most alert and focused?

When do you typically feel your energy dip?

Match these patterns to your task types

Step 3: Create your initial blocks

Block one 2-hour session for deep work during your peak energy time

Schedule 30 minutes daily for email and admin

Add a 15-minute buffer between significant blocks

Include a 30-minute daily planning session (ideally at day's end)

Step 4: Protect your schedule

Schedule deep work as recurring meetings in your calendar

If using shared calendars, mark deep work time as "busy"

Build in 30 minutes of flex time for unexpected issues

Keep your most productive hours sacred for important work

Step 5: Review and adjust

After one week:

What worked well?

Which blocks need adjusting?

Are your buffer times sufficient?

Do the blocks align with your energy levels?

Pro tips

Start small - you don't need to block every minute

Move blocks when needed, but protect deep work time

Create a simple template for your ideal day

Review and adjust weekly

Key takeaways

Proactive scheduling trumps reactivity. Time-blocking is fundamentally about moving from a reactive to a proactive approach to work. Instead of letting your day be dictated by incoming emails or whoever interrupts you first, you intentionally decide upfront how you'll spend your time. This means deliberately allocating specific blocks for meaningful work before other demands can claim that time.

Flexibility within structure. While time-blocking provides a structured approach to managing your day, it's not a rigid schedule; your time-block plan should adapt to changing contexts. The key is creating a guide that helps you make intentional choices about your work, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate unexpected priorities or interruptions.

Holistic time management. Time-blocking isn't just about work tasks - it's about creating a balanced approach to your entire day. I recommend blocking out time not just for professional tasks, but also for rest, relaxation, family, and social activities. By scheduling these important personal elements, you're signalling a commitment to a sustainable, well-rounded approach to productivity that prevents burnout and supports meaningful work.
