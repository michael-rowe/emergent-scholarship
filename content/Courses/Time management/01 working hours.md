Lesson overview

Objective: Establish a fixed working schedule

Summary: Your ability to do meaningful academic work depends more on managing your limited cognitive energy than extending your working hours. Most people only have the mental energy to complete a few hours of deep work per day - protect these for your highest-value work. The key is working backwards - rather than letting work expand to fill the available time, start with your fixed schedule and make intentional choices about what fits within it. This might feel uncomfortable at first, but it's the foundation for sustainable academic productivity.

Key habits:

Set a firm end time for your workday and stick to it, even when work is unfinished

Track your actual working hours, not your planned hours, to see where boundaries slip

Build a 10-minute end-of-day routine to process remaining tasks and prepare for tomorrow

Communicate your working hours clearly to colleagues and students, then model those boundaries consistently

Remember: The goal isn't to work less, but to work intentionally within sustainable boundaries. Your best thinking happens when you're fresh, not when you're stretched thin.

Introduction

Working longer hours will almost never give you the solution to the problems you care about. One of the great privileges of academic work is that you can often work flexible hours, but just because you can work anywhere and any time, it doesn't mean that you should. Each of us has about 3-4 'good' hours in us, where our cognitive energy is highest. This lesson is about making sure you allocate those hours appropriately.

Creativity, progress, and impact do not yield to brute force.

Hannson & Fried

Fixed-schedule productivity

Working longer hours rarely leads to better outcomes in academia. The law of diminishing returns (see image right) shows us that after about 3-4 hours of deep work, each additional hour yields progressively less value while increasing stress and fatigue. Yet many academics respond to pressure by extending their workday, letting work seep into evenings and weekends—a strategy that ultimately undermines both productivity and well-being.

Fixed-schedule productivity offers a more sustainable approach. Instead of letting work expand to fill every available moment, you establish clear boundaries around your working hours and then fit your tasks within those limits. This might seem impossible in academia, but it's precisely these constraints that drive better decision-making about how you use your time.

Key principles of fixed-schedule productivity:

Focus on protecting 3-4 hours of peak cognitive energy each day for your most valuable work

Work backward from fixed hours to make strategic choices about priorities

Set firm end times to your workday and stick to them, even when work is unfinished

Use an end-of-day ritual to process remaining tasks and mentally disconnect

Make your schedule public to help others respect your boundaries

Plan regularly since you're working within constraints rather than letting work expand endlessly

The goal isn't to work less, but to work more intentionally. When you establish clear boundaries between work and rest, you create the conditions for both meaningful academic contributions and a sustainable career. Your best thinking happens when you're fresh and focused, not when you're stretched thin across endless hours.

Law of diminishing returns

Practical examples

Fixing your work hours isn't about being inflexible - it's about being intentional with your limited energy and showing others that academic work can be both meaningful and sustainable. Here are some practical examples demonstrating how you can still achieve your goals while maintaining your working boundaries.

Set a non-negotiable end time for your workday

Move early morning grant writing to a different location (like the library) to avoid disruption

Let colleagues know you're unavailable before 11:00

If you haven't finished by your fixed time, note where you stopped and what comes next, then close your laptop

The key is protecting your finite energy for high-value work, not stretching your day to accommodate everything.

Communicate clear response windows in your course outline (e.g. 24-hour response time during work hours)

Set up an email autoresponder stating your working hours

Schedule specific times for email responses during your workday

Resist the urge to "quickly check" emails outside work hours

Remember: Being available 24/7 doesn't make you a better teacher; being present and energised during work hours does.

Define your firm daily start and end times

Build in buffer time for genuinely urgent matters

Delegate what can be handled by others

When you reach your end time, postpone non-critical tasks to tomorrow

Your leadership is more effective when you model sustainable work practices.

Set clear supervision boundaries in your first meeting (e.g. "I'm available 9am-5pm weekdays")

Schedule regular supervision slots during your work hours, not early mornings or evenings

Create a shared document for students to note urgent discussion points between meetings

If students send late-night messages, respond during your next work day

Remember: Students learn sustainable academic practices from you. By respecting your own boundaries, you teach them to develop healthy working patterns for their careers.

Energy mapping exercise

The purpose of this energy mapping exercise is to helps you work within fixed hours by identifying your 3-4 hours of peak cognitive energy each day, making it clear why extending your workday rarely leads to better outcomes.

Pause and reflect

Take a moment to consider how fixed schedules might work in your academic context. Think about your current working patterns - when do you start and end your day? How often do you work in the evenings or weekends? Consider what boundaries you could realistically establish, keeping in mind that the goal isn't to work fewer hours but to work more intentionally within sustainable limits.

Now imagine what your work life would look like with clearer boundaries. What would be your ideal end time each day? Which tasks would you prioritise during your peak cognitive hours? What changes would you need to make to your current commitments and habits? Establishing fixed schedules isn't about being inflexible - it's about creating the mental space needed for meaningful academic work while maintaining a sustainable long-term practice.

Activity

Today, start building your fixed-schedule foundation with these simple steps:

Choose your end time for today - not shorter than your contracted hours, but not longer either

Review your tasks and move anything non-essential to later in the week

Set an alarm for 10 minutes before your chosen end time to help you wrap up

Use this wrap-up time to quickly process remaining tasks into your calendar

Before leaving, place a sticky note on your laptop that says "Don't work at night" as a reminder

Bonus step: Share your commitment to fixed hours with family or colleagues and ask them to gently help you stick to it. Over the next few lessons, we'll build the routines and systems to help maintain these boundaries.

Key takeaways

Working longer hours rarely leads to better solutions in academic work. The law of diminishing returns shows that after about 3-4 peak cognitive hours, additional time yields progressively less value.

Fixed-schedule productivity means establishing clear boundaries around your working hours and then working backwards to ensure tasks fit within those constraints, rather than letting work expand to fill the available time.

Fixed schedules only work when you commit to the whole system - public accountability with family and colleagues, practical tools like scheduling alarms, and the willingness to make tough decisions about what truly fits in your day.
