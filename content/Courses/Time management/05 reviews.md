Lesson overview

Objective: Use weekly reviews to plan more effectively

Summary: Weekly reviews transform academic workflow by systematically closing open loops and allocating time for meaningful work. While intensive, this practice helps academics transition from reactive task management to intentional engagement with their scholarship. When done consistently, it enables true disconnection from work during rest periods, leading to both higher productivity and better well-being.

Key habits:

Create clear boundaries between work and rest by finishing each weekly review with a complete reset

Schedule a fixed time for weekly reviews - protect this time as you would any other high-value commitment

Process inputs completely - either close loops immediately or create clear next actions with specific time blocks

Maintain a trusted system for capturing and organising commitments

Introduction

Think about how you typically feel at the end of your work week. If you're like many academics, there's often a lingering sense of unease associated with unfinished tasks and looming commitments that make it hard to truly disconnect. But what if you could end each week with clarity and confidence, knowing exactly where your work stands and what comes next?

A plan is simply a statement of intent and not a description of the future.

Oliver Burkeman

Close open loops

Open loops are those unfinished tasks and unprocessed commitments that occupy your mind. Think about those tasks and ideas that keep tapping at your mental door - the conference paper you need to review, the student waiting for feedback, the reading notes that need processing. Each of these "open loops" occupies valuable mental bandwidth, acting like a small background process running in your mind. By learning to capture and process these loops, you create the literal and figurative space needed for deeper thinking and more meaningful work.

This systematic approach to closing loops might feel intensive at first - and it should, because you're making numerous small decisions rather than letting things drift. But this investment pays off in reduced anxiety and increased clarity throughout your week. When you know that every commitment has been captured and every next action defined, you can engage more fully with your current task or truly relax during your downtime.

Let's look at some common open loops across different academic roles.

Examples of closing open loops

The following flashcards present common open loops that academics encounter, along with practical suggestions for closing them. Each card's front shows typical unfinished tasks or unprocessed items, while the back provides concrete steps for either closing these loops immediately or putting them into a task management system. The examples on the back of each card are also categorised by the time and effort needed to address them. Take note of how each solution either closes the loop completely or places it into a system with a clear next action.

Creating space for what matters

Your weekly review isn't about cramming more into your schedule or optimising every minute. Instead, it's about creating the mental and temporal space needed for your most important work. When you know your commitments are captured and your next steps are clear, you can fully engage with your current task without that background hum of worry about what you might be forgetting.

This practice aligns with the natural rhythms of academic life - the ebb and flow of teaching terms, research projects, and writing cycles. By establishing regular points for reflection and realignment, you're not just managing tasks; you're cultivating a sustainable approach to scholarly work that can carry you through your entire career.

Pause and reflect

It can be seductive to spend more time managing your schedule than doing the actual work. This is why I use a template to make sure my reviews remain focused and purposeful. A weekly review isn't a relaxing period - if anything, I end these sessions more mentally drained than at any other time during the week, because I'm making many small decisions about tasks, commitments, and priorities. In some cases I'm also doing the work, if the tasks are likely to take only a few minutes.

But this intensity serves a purpose. When I complete my review on Friday, my email inbox is typically empty, my tasks are processed, and my next week is broadly mapped out. This allows me to disconnect completely over the weekend, knowing that nothing important has slipped through the cracks. While the review itself is demanding, it creates the mental space needed for genuine rest and recovery.

Activity

This activity introduces you to the practice of weekly reviews while helping you develop a sustainable approach to planning your work. It's important to note that I still update my review template every few months, even after having engaged in this activity for almost 5 years. If you've never done this kind of systematic review, it will probably take considerable time to get into a form that works for you.

Starting point (30 minutes)

Download the weekly review template (see right)

Read through each section, noting which elements resonate with your current needs

Identify 2-3 areas that would make the biggest difference to your workflow

Consider your natural weekly rhythm - when do you typically have energy for reflection?

Customise your approach (45 minutes)

Choose a quiet time to try a simplified version of the review focusing on your identified priority areas

Use the template as a guide rather than a strict checklist

Add or modify sections based on your specific academic role and responsibilities

Note which parts feel most valuable and which feel like friction

Test and refine (2 weeks)

Schedule two 90-minute blocks over the next two weeks for your modified review

Start with the basics: gathering loose items, processing inputs, and planning ahead

Keep notes on what works well and what needs adjustment

Pay attention to the impact on your work week - are you feeling more clarity? Less mental overhead?

Establish your practice (ongoing)

Based on your test period, define your own sustainable review practice

Determine your ideal timing (e.g., Friday afternoon, Sunday evening, Monday morning)

Decide on your essential elements vs. optional components

Create your personalised version of the template

Remember:

The goal is to create a sustainable practice, not perfect execution

Start small and build gradually

Adjust the scope based on your energy and available time

Focus on what helps you close open loops and create mental space

This activity provides a comprehensive framework, but your weekly review should ultimately reflect your unique needs and constraints. Aim to find a rhythm that helps you maintain a sense of calm productivity without the process becoming another source of pressure.

Key takeaways

Mental clarity through structure. Instead of letting unfinished tasks and ideas constantly tap on your mental door, a weekly review gives them a proper home. By systematically capturing and processing these open loops, you create the mental space needed for deeper thinking and creative work. It's not about perfection - it's about having a trusted system that lets your mind truly rest when you're away from work.

Reviews as strategic investment. While a 2-3 hour weekly review might seem like a luxury, consider it an investment that pays dividends throughout your week. This focused time helps you:

Prevent small tasks from becoming urgent crises

Maintain momentum on important projects

Reduce the mental overhead of trying to remember everything

Create natural boundaries between work and personal time

Building sustainable practices. The goal isn't to create another demanding obligation in your schedule. Start small, perhaps with a 30-minute review, and let the practice evolve naturally as you discover what works best for you. The key is consistency over perfection - a simple review you actually complete is far more valuable than an elaborate system you abandon.
