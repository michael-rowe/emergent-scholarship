> A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days…it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time.

**While academics probably have more autonomy around structuring their days than many other employees, few feel as if they have any control at all**, often spending their days reacting to a rising tide of demands for their attention. There's no time to breathe when you're running all the time. When your working day feels beyond your control, it's hard to pay attention to anything other than what's in front of you. We feel like we're working all the time, and that we bounce around between tasks without any focus. We get to the end of the week feeling like we've made no progress on our most important work, only to look ahead at the next week with the same sense of dread.

Much of the anxiety associated with academic work stems from a feeling that your schedule is out of your control; that you have no autonomy in planning your day. The purpose of this course is to help you establish a space in your schedule to pause, reflect, and build a system of habits and routines for calm productivity.

2. Define the different types of tasks in your working context.
3. Allocate specific tasks to specific blocks of time in your schedule.
