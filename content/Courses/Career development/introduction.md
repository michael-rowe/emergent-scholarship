**Creating a more effective system for academic work means little if it isn't tied to a higher purpose**. Even though knowledge work is the defining characteristic of academia, we nonetheless find it difficult to articulate what it looks like in our personal contexts, and how to systematically get better at doing it. Direction is more important than speed. If your career is moving in the right direction, you will reach your destination eventually. But, moving quickly in the wrong direction just makes the problem worse. So it's worth spending time, maybe even a lot of time, reflecting on what you want your academic career development to look like.

Increased productivity for its own sake won't necessarily satisfy you, especially if you're not convinced the work you're doing has real value. Which is why this course is about high-impact, long-term academic career development in the service of pressing problems. It's about setting priorities that will move you closer to a career that has a positive impact in the world.
