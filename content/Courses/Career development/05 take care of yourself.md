Lesson overview

Objective: Embed self-care into your career development

Summary: This lesson focuses on integrating sustainable self-care practices into your academic workflow to create the conditions for meaningful, high-value work. Rather than viewing rest as a reward for productivity, we position it as the foundation that enables good work to emerge. The lesson provides practical strategies adapted for different academic roles - whether you're focused on teaching, research, leadership, or administration - helping you build habits that support both professional achievement and personal wellbeing.

Key habits:

Create intentional recovery periods by scheduling 15-30 minute breaks between intensive work sessions, treating them as non-negotiable parts of your day.

Define and defend your work boundaries by establishing consistent start and end times to your day, along with clear limits on when you'll engage with email and other communications.

Integrate movement into your daily workflow by taking walking breaks, standing while reading, or scheduling regular exercise sessions that work within your academic schedule.

Prioritise sleep by setting up routines and an environment that support good rest, including a consistent bedtime and a workspace separate from your rest space.

Introduction

The activities we typically turn to during breaks rarely help us recover. Whether it's checking social media during short gaps between meetings or trying to catch up on writing during longer academic breaks, we often end up feeling more drained afterwards, wondering why we can never seem to get ahead.

When your sense of self-worth becomes tied to your academic productivity, it's easy to feel constant pressure to achieve more. But focusing solely on external measures of success creates a working environment where you're always depleted and never restored. This lesson is about building sustainable practices that support both your wellbeing and your academic goals. We'll explore practical strategies for integrating rest and recovery into your schedule, with specific adaptations for different academic roles. After all, a successful academic career is more like a marathon than a sprint - and even marathoners know the value of pacing and recovery.

…it's tempting to sacrifice well-being for success. Pushing past exhaustion brings short-term rewards. Over time, well-being is vital to success. Daily exhaustion adds up to long-term burnout. Success can be attained without rest, but it isn't sustained without rest.

Making space for recovery

Your career in academia is more like a marathon than a sprint. While there will be times when you need to increase your pace - for example, when preparing a funding proposal or finalising grades - working at maximum intensity shouldn't be your default mode. Building a sustainable academic career means creating space for both intense work and meaningful recovery.

Rest isn't just about preventing burnout; it's about creating the conditions where your best work can emerge. When you include regular periods of recovery in your schedule, you:

Return to your work with renewed energy and perspective

Have more capacity for creative and analytical thinking

Maintain better focus during periods of intense work

Build resilience for challenging times

Think of recovery as an investment in your future productivity, not a cost to your current output. Just as elite athletes carefully balance training and recovery to achieve peak performance, academics need to find their own sustainable rhythm of engagement and restoration.

This lesson embodies the fundamental principle that meaningful academic work emerges from a foundation of calm and intentional practice, not from constant pressure and overwork. By integrating deliberate self-care into your workflow, you create the mental and physical space needed to engage deeply with your most valuable projects. This isn't about working less – it's about working more effectively and sustainably.

Self-care strategies across roles

While the principles of self-care remain constant, how you implement them may depend on your specific academic responsibilities. Let's explore how different aspects of academic work - teaching, research, leadership, and administration - create unique challenges and opportunities for integrating self-care into a daily routine.

Managing energy around teaching blocks

Schedule "recovery blocks" after intensive teaching sessions - even 15 minutes of quiet time can help restore energy

Build in buffer time between classes for physical movement and mental reset

Plan lighter administrative work for post-teaching periods when mental energy is depleted

Whatever combination of roles you hold, the key is to adapt these strategies to fit your specific context. Start with one or two practices that seem most relevant and build from there.

Pause and reflect

After implementing the advice in this course, you may paradoxically feel increased pressure to "be productive." With these new tools and techniques, you might find yourself wondering if you could optimise even further - squeeze in more work, be more efficient, achieve more. This tendency to keep pushing for ever-greater productivity is exactly what we're trying to avoid. The course aims to help you achieve a state of calm productivity, but that shouldn't become another source of stress or a reason to constantly seek more optimisation.

Instead, we're aiming to create a sustainable way of working that aligns with your personal definition of a meaningful academic career. Success isn't about doing more; it's about doing what matters, while maintaining your well-being over the long term. Ask yourself: What would a satisfying and sustainable academic career look like for you? How can you structure your work in a way that supports both your professional goals and your personal well-being? The answers to these questions will help guide your implementation of these practices in a way that serves your broader life goals, not just your productivity metrics.

Activity

Starting small is key to creating sustainable change. Rather than trying to implement everything at once, choose one area to focus on initially. Here's how to begin:

Exercise and movement

Schedule three 30-minute exercise sessions into your weekly calendar

This could be as simple as a brisk walk or basic stretching

Focus on consistency rather than intensity

Try different times of day to find what works best

Sleep and recovery

Set a consistent bedtime that allows for 7-9 hours of sleep

Create an evening routine that helps you wind down

Consider using an alarm to remind you when to start preparing for sleep

Keep your bedroom environment conducive to rest

Restorative activities

Identify 2-3 activities that genuinely restore your energy

These might be reading, walking in nature, or spending time with friends

Schedule these activities regularly, treating them as important as any meeting

Notice which activities drain versus restore your energy

Planning breaks with the EASY goals framework (see right):

Energising: Choose activities that restore your depleted energy

Agential: Ensure you have control over starting and making progress

Small: Scale the project to complete within your break

Yours: Select activities you want to do, not what you think you should do

Implementation tip: Start with just one of these areas. Once you've established that as a routine, add another. Remember that small, consistent changes are more sustainable than dramatic overhauls.

Key takeaways

Rest isn't something you earn after being productive - it's what makes sustained productivity possible. When you prioritise rest and recovery, you create the conditions for your best thinking and most creative work. The benefits of good rest habits compound over time, enhancing both your academic output and your well-being.

Meaningful academic success rarely comes from constantly pushing for more productivity or working longer hours. Instead, it tends to develop gradually through consistent, intentional effort. While there will be times when you need to sprint to meet specific deadlines, this shouldn't be your default mode. Real progress comes from building sustainable foundations that support long-term growth.

Self-care isn't optional - it's essential for a successful academic career. This means deliberately scheduling time for exercise, protecting your sleep, and nurturing relationships that restore your energy. Start with small, manageable changes that you can maintain consistently. Use tools like the EASY framework (Energising, Agential, Small, Yours) to plan breaks that genuinely rejuvenate rather than drain you. Remember that taking care of yourself isn't just about health - it's about creating the conditions where your best academic work can emerge.
