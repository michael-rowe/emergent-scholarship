Creating a more effective system for academic work means little if it isn't tied to a higher purpose. Even though knowledge work is the defining characteristic of academia, we nonetheless find it difficult to articulate what it looks like in our personal contexts, and how to systematically get better at doing it. The aim of this course on academic career development is to create a deeper understanding of your working context as a starting point for designing a sustainable and meaningful academic career.

If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.

Course objectives

Describe your working context.

Identify a pressing problem to focus your career on.

Build routines that help master your craft.

Strategically position yourself within professional networks.

Embed self-care into your career development.

Direction is more important than speed. If your career is moving in the right direction, you will reach your destination eventually. But, moving quickly in the wrong direction just makes the problem worse. So it's worth spending time, maybe even a lot of time, reflecting on what you want your academic career development to look like.

Increased productivity for its own sake won't necessarily satisfy you, especially if you're not convinced the work you're doing has real value. Which is why this course is about high-impact, long-term academic career development in the service of pressing problems. It's about setting priorities that will move you closer to a career that has a positive impact in the world.

Buy this course on career development to start building a focused, long-term plan for your career.
