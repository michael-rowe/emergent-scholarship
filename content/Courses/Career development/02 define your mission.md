> [!info] Lesson overview
> **Objective:** Identify a pressing problem to focus your career on
>
> **Summary:** Defining your academic mission means identifying important problems where you can make meaningful contributions. Early-career academics should focus on well-defined "normal" problems, while experienced scholars can tackle complex "wicked" problems that cross disciplinary boundaries. Your mission statement should be forward-looking, connecting your unique skills to larger challenges. This clarity creates the head space needed for sustainable, high-impact work by helping you distinguish between what's urgent and what's truly important.
>
> **Key habits:**
>
> - Regular horizon scanning: Dedicate time monthly to explore emerging challenges in your field and adjacent disciplines to identify meaningful problems where your expertise could contribute
> - Skills-to-impact mapping: Quarterly, evaluate how your developing expertise connects to pressing problems, adjusting your focus as your capabilities evolve
> - Mission-aligned decision making: Before accepting new commitments, explicitly evaluate them against your mission statement to protect your focus and energy
> - Reflective adaptation: Schedule bi-annual reviews of your mission statement, assessing how evolving knowledge and emerging challenges might reshape your understanding of your optimal contribution

## Introduction

Being more efficient isn't the same as being effective. Without a clear mission, you might work productively but feel unfulfilled. Without a mission, or sense of purpose, you may find yourself working quickly and productively, without the satisfaction that comes with feeling that you're making a difference.

One way to find that purpose is to focus on a pressing problem. Pressing problems have no simple solutions, require multi-disciplinary approaches, have complex effects on society, and are characterised by complexity. A well-defined mission helps you prioritise high-value work that builds career capital rather than getting lost in shallow tasks that merely fill time.

When you've defined your mission clearly, daily decisions become simpler. This mental clarity creates the head space needed for deep work by reducing the cognitive burden of constantly questioning your direction. A well-defined mission serves as a compass, allowing you to navigate competing demands with confidence and focus your energy on truly meaningful contributions.

## Finding your problem space

If you're early in your academic career, consider focusing on 'normal' problems—those with relatively clear boundaries and established methods. These problems offer solid ground to build expertise while making meaningful contributions.

As you advance in your career, you might find yourself drawn to what scholars call 'wicked problems'—complex challenges that resist simple definitions and solutions. These problems often involve ethical dilemmas, competing stakeholder interests, and shifting parameters. They're messy by nature, evolving as our understanding of them changes, and they frequently span traditional disciplinary boundaries.

For instance, an early-career health scientist might focus on improving specific diagnostic techniques (a 'normal' problem), while a senior researcher might tackle healthcare inequity (a 'wicked' problem) that involves medical, social, economic, and political dimensions.

Emergent scholarship thrives at these intersections, where patterns and connections form across traditional boundaries. Your most impactful work may arise not from rigid plans but from remaining responsive to evolving challenges and unexpected insights.

Consider these perspectives when shaping your mission:

- Choose problems that energise rather than drain you—sustained progress requires genuine engagement
- Start with manageable challenges that provide clear feedback loops for skill development
- Recognise that your mission will evolve as your expertise and understanding deepen
- Look for problems where your unique background offers fresh perspectives
- Consider how your work connects to broader societal challenges, even if indirectly

Remember that defining your mission isn't about restricting yourself—it's about creating focus that generates momentum. A well-defined mission helps you navigate the constant barrage of opportunities and distractions that fragment academic attention.

## Sustainable mission development

Defining your mission requires balancing ambition with sustainability. The most impactful academic careers are built on consistent, meaningful contribution rather than frantic activity.

Balance ambition with sustainability. Your mission should inspire you while remaining achievable. Consider it a marathon rather than a sprint—pace yourself for the long term. The most sustainable missions create a clear bridge between your unique capabilities and meaningful impact.

Create boundaries that protect your focus. A well-defined mission clarifies what to pursue and what to decline. This boundary-setting creates the head space needed for deep work. When your mission is clear, saying "no" becomes less about disappointing colleagues and more about honouring your purpose.

Build reflection cycles. Schedule quarterly "mission alignment" sessions to assess whether your work advances your mission, if new knowledge has shifted your understanding, and whether you're maintaining the resources needed for long-term impact.

Connect personal sustainability to mission effectiveness. The quality of your contribution depends on your well-being. Your sustainability practices—adequate rest, focused work periods, and regular renewal—aren't separate from your mission but essential components of it. The most effective academics understand that sustained impact requires sustainable practices.

## Practical examples

Here are some examples of vague mission statements that can be enhanced.

> [!example]- Faculty development
> **Before:** "I want to improve teaching practices at my university"
>
> **After:** "I will develop evidence-based faculty mentoring systems that help early-career academics balance research demands with teaching excellence, focusing particularly on interdisciplinary programs"

> [!example]- Law
> **Before:** "I aim to publish important legal scholarship"
>
> **After:** "I will examine how emerging technologies challenge existing privacy frameworks, developing practical guidelines that help legislators balance innovation with fundamental rights in data protection"

> [!example]- Psychology
> **Before:** "I want to research cognitive development in children"
>
> **After:** "I will investigate how digital technology exposure affects executive function development in children aged 3-7, creating accessible assessment tools and intervention strategies that parents and educators can implement across diverse socioeconomic contexts"

> [!example]- Engineering
> **Before:** "I want to advance knowledge in sustainable engineering"
>
> **After:** "I will design modular, low-cost water purification systems adaptable to diverse community contexts, focusing on implementation approaches that build local technical capacity and ownership"

> [!example]- Literature
> **Before:** "My mission is to analyse contemporary fiction"
>
> **After:** "I will investigate how digital storytelling platforms transform narrative structures, developing frameworks that help educators integrate these evolving literary forms into curriculum while preserving critical reading skills"

> [!example]- Nursing
> **Before:** "My mission is to contribute to nursing education"
>
> **After:** "I will create simulation-based training protocols that bridge the theory-practice gap for nursing students in rural healthcare settings, addressing the specific challenges of limited-resource environments"

> [!question] Pause and reflect
> Be cautious about advice to "follow your passion." Meaningful work typically comes from developing expertise that contributes to significant problems, though you should still avoid committing to work you find uninspiring.
>
> Rather than rigidly adhering to predetermined career paths, emergent scholarship embraces adaptability and responsiveness to evolving problems. Your mission should serve as a guiding star, not a constraining box. As you develop expertise, remain attentive to unexpected connections and emerging opportunities that may reshape your understanding of how your unique contributions can address pressing problems.
>
> If you're struggling to identify a clear mission, consider focusing first on developing mastery in your field. As you approach the boundaries of current knowledge, promising directions will become more apparent. Remember that your mission will evolve. What you write today is a starting point—a direction rather than a destination.

## Activity

> [!todo]- Draft your mission statement
> The purpose of this activity is to draft a personal mission statement that connects your skills and interests to meaningful problems. Use the template on the right to provide more detailed structure to your planning.
>
> **Step 1: Problem exploration**
>
> List 3-5 pressing problems that deeply concern you. These could range from discipline-specific challenges to broader societal issues.
>
> For each problem, briefly evaluate:
> - **Scope:** Is it a "normal" well-defined problem or a "wicked" complex challenge?
> - **Impact:** Who would benefit from progress on this problem?
> - **Alignment:** How does this connect to your existing skills and knowledge?
> - **Feasibility:** Could you realistically contribute to addressing this?
> - **Personal connection:** Why does this problem matter to you?
>
> Based on your evaluation, select the problem that offers the strongest combination of impact, alignment with your capabilities, and personal meaning.
>
> **Step 2: Mission development**
> - What rare and valuable skills do you possess that could help address this problem?
> - What skill gaps do you need to fill to make greater impact?
> - Why are you well-positioned to focus on this problem? What gives you a unique perspective?
> - What steps will you take to develop expertise at the cutting edge of your field?
> - What connections in your existing networks could help advance your mission?
> - Do you need to build new relationships, strengthen existing ones, or reconsider some connections?
> - What specific contribution do you hope to make to this problem?
>
> Remember, this exercise isn't about creating a perfect mission statement, but starting to think strategically about your direction. Your mission will evolve as you develop deeper insights into your field and the problems you're addressing.
