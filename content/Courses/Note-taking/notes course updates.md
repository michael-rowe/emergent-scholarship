# Note-taking for academics

_Building a system that extends your thinking and supports meaningful work_

---

## When your thinking is scattered, your work is scattered

You take notes everywhere. During meetings, when reading articles, at conferences, while preparing lectures, in conversations with colleagues. Some notes live in your reference manager, others in Word documents, more in Google Docs, a few in email drafts, scattered across project management apps, written in notebooks that you'll probably never find again.

This isn't just organisational chaos—it's cognitive fragmentation. When your notes are scattered, your thinking is scattered. The insight you captured three months ago that would solve today's problem is buried in a document you can't locate. The connection between two research threads that could generate a new project remains invisible because the relevant notes never meet. The work you did processing a difficult concept is lost because you have no consistent place to develop and preserve your thinking.

**Most academics treat note-taking as administrative overhead rather than intellectual work.** A quick capture of someone's contact details gets the same treatment as your carefully developed understanding of a key concept in your field. Daily tasks sit alongside lifelong insights. The temporary and the permanent are indistinguishable, which means the truly valuable notes—the ones that represent genuine cognitive work—get lost in operational noise.

This course builds a note-taking system where different types of notes serve different purposes, and where your most valuable thinking has a permanent home.

## What you'll learn

This course provides a complete framework for note-taking that extends your working memory and long-term memory while supporting your actual academic work. By the end, you'll be able to:

1. **Establish a daily notes habit** that extends your working memory and provides a reliable space for tracking operational information
2. **Capture fleeting thoughts** using temporary notes that prevent interruptions while ensuring nothing important is lost
3. **Engage critically with sources** through literature notes that document your thinking rather than just excerpting content
4. **Structure complex projects** using dedicated project notes that provide clarity and support both individual and collaborative work
5. **Build lasting knowledge** through permanent notes that preserve your developed understanding for a lifetime

## Why note-taking systems matter

Without a conceptual framework for different types of notes, academics tend towards two extremes: either capturing everything in an undifferentiated mass, or relying on memory and losing most of their thinking. Both approaches create problems.

When every note is treated the same way, your system becomes unmanageable. The reminder to call the finance office sits next to your carefully articulated understanding of a theoretical framework. Meeting agendas mix with permanent insights. The volume overwhelms the value. You spend more time managing notes than working with the ideas they contain.

Alternatively, if you avoid taking notes because your system feels too cumbersome, you're essentially choosing to forget. Academic work requires holding complex ideas in relationship to each other, remembering connections across sources, and building understanding over time. Human memory is unreliable for this work. Without external systems, you're constantly starting from scratch rather than building from accumulated thinking.

**Notes should be extensions of your memory—both working memory for immediate operational needs and long-term memory for enduring insights.** Different types of notes serve different functions, and the system works when you can distinguish between them.

The challenge isn't finding the perfect note-taking app or the most elegant workflow. It's developing a conceptual framework that helps you recognise what kind of note you're creating and where it belongs in your larger system.

## Course structure

### Lesson 1: Daily notes

Daily notes function as extensions of your working memory—a reliable place to track operational information for each day. This lesson explores establishing a sustainable daily notes practice:

- Creating space to record tasks, commitments, and fleeting observations without cluttering other systems
- Using daily notes to track what you've accomplished during the week
- Building weekly review habits that connect daily notes to longer-term work
- Maintaining daily notes as both planning tools and records of completed work

**Practical outcome:** You'll develop a consistent habit of using daily notes to manage immediate cognitive load, freeing mental space for deeper work while creating a record of your progress over time.

### Lesson 2: Temporary notes

Academic work generates constant fleeting thoughts—article references, half-formed ideas, quick observations—that need capturing without derailing current work. This lesson addresses how to handle these ephemeral notes:

- Distinguishing genuinely temporary information from ideas worth developing
- Creating friction-free capture systems that don't interrupt focused work
- Processing temporary notes regularly to move information into appropriate systems
- Developing the discipline to delete processed temporary notes rather than accumulating them indefinitely

**Practical outcome:** You'll establish a reliable capture system that prevents interruptions to your focused work while ensuring nothing important is lost, reducing the anxiety of trying to remember everything.

### Lesson 3: Literature notes

Reading without capturing your thinking means re-encountering the same ideas as if for the first time. This lesson explores creating literature notes that document your intellectual engagement:

- Taking notes that capture your understanding and questions rather than just excerpting content
- Connecting literature notes to sources in ways that remain useful months or years later
- Creating literature notes across different media formats—articles, books, presentations, podcasts
- Building a reference system that makes your past thinking accessible when needed

**Practical outcome:** You'll develop practices for capturing your critical engagement with sources, creating a foundation for permanent notes and making your reading genuinely cumulative rather than repetitive.

### Lesson 4: Project notes

Academic projects span extended periods and involve multiple moving parts that need coordination. This lesson examines using project notes to maintain clarity:

- Creating dedicated spaces for projects that separate them from daily operational notes
- Tracking project-specific information—resources, decisions, progress, stakeholders—in accessible locations
- Structuring project notes for both solo work and collaborative contexts
- Archiving completed project notes in ways that preserve useful information without cluttering active systems

**Practical outcome:** You'll learn to structure project notes that support complex, extended work while remaining flexible enough to adapt to varied academic project types, from solo research to multi-institutional collaborations.

### Lesson 5: Permanent notes

While most notes are operational and temporary, some represent genuine intellectual work worth preserving. This lesson introduces creating permanent notes:

- Distinguishing between notes about sources (literature notes) and notes about concepts (permanent notes)
- Developing your thinking through the act of writing permanent notes
- Creating notes at appropriate levels of abstraction—neither too broad nor too narrow
- Building a collection of permanent notes that evolves with your understanding over time

**Practical outcome:** You'll begin building a permanent note collection that captures and develops your understanding of key concepts, creating intellectual capital that grows more valuable throughout your career.

## This course is ideal for you if:

**Your notes are scattered across multiple systems**  
You take notes in various places but can never find what you need when you need it, leading to repeated work and lost insights.

**You struggle to distinguish between different kinds of information**  
Quick reminders receive the same treatment as carefully developed thinking, making it difficult to recognise what's genuinely valuable in your system.

**You want your reading to be cumulative rather than repetitive**  
You find yourself re-reading sources because you can't access your previous thinking, or you forget you've already engaged with key ideas.

**You're overwhelmed by trying to remember everything**  
You rely on memory for operational details, creating constant low-level anxiety about forgetting commitments or losing ideas.

**You value building intellectual capital over time**  
You recognise that your developed understanding of concepts is genuinely valuable and deserves preservation and ongoing development.

---

## This course isn't right for you if:

**You're looking for app-specific tutorials**  
While examples may reference specific tools, the focus is on conceptual frameworks rather than platform-specific instructions.

**You want a perfect system before starting**  
The course emphasises developing sustainable practices through experimentation rather than waiting for an ideal setup.

**You're hoping note-taking will eliminate all workflow problems**  
Note-taking systems support your work but aren't solutions to systemic institutional challenges or unreasonable workloads.

**You expect immediate transformation**  
Building effective note-taking habits requires sustained practice. This course provides frameworks, but implementation takes time.

---

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need special software to take this course?**  
No. The frameworks work with any note-taking system, from physical notebooks to dedicated apps. If you're using digital tools, any basic note-taking application will work—the course focuses on concepts rather than specific platforms.

**I've tried note-taking systems before and they've never stuck. Why would this be different?**  
Many note-taking systems fail because they're too complicated or don't match how academic work actually happens. This course builds from recognising different types of notes and treating them appropriately, rather than forcing everything into a single structure.

**How much time should I expect to spend on note-taking?**  
The goal isn't to add time to your day but to make time you already spend more productive. Most people complete the course over 4-6 weeks, spending about 2-3 hours per week on lessons and activities. The note-taking practices themselves become integrated into existing work rather than separate tasks.

**Will this course teach me a specific note-taking method like Zettelkasten?**  
The course draws on various approaches but doesn't prescribe a single method. Instead, it provides frameworks for recognising different note types and working with them appropriately, which you can adapt to your specific context and preferences.

**What's the difference between literature notes and permanent notes?**  
Literature notes capture your thinking about specific sources—what an author argues, your questions about their approach, connections to other work. Permanent notes capture your understanding of concepts that transcend any single source. Most permanent notes begin as observations in literature notes but develop into something more general.

**Can I use this system collaboratively?**  
While the course focuses primarily on personal note-taking systems, the frameworks (particularly around project notes) apply to collaborative contexts. How you implement collaborative note-taking will depend on your specific tools and team workflows.

## On building systems that support thinking

Every academic I speak with has some form of note-taking practice. Most recognise that notes are important. But few have developed clear frameworks for distinguishing between different types of notes or understanding what each type of note should accomplish.

This creates two common problems: either notes accumulate in an undifferentiated mass that becomes overwhelming to manage, or academics avoid taking notes because their systems feel too burdensome, relying instead on memory and losing most of their thinking in the process.

**The academics who work most effectively with notes aren't using the most sophisticated tools or the most elaborate systems.** They've developed clear conceptual frameworks that help them recognise what kind of note they're creating and where it belongs. They understand the difference between operational notes that serve immediate needs and permanent notes that capture lasting intellectual work.

This course won't give you a perfect note-taking system—those don't exist because academic work varies too much across disciplines, roles, and personal preferences. Instead, it provides frameworks you can adapt to your specific context, helping you build a system that genuinely supports your thinking rather than adding administrative overhead.

The question isn't whether notes are valuable—you already know they are. The question is whether you'll have the conceptual frameworks to work with notes in ways that genuinely extend your thinking rather than just accumulating information.

# Lesson 1: Daily

**Weaknesses and Solutions**: One potential weakness is the assumption that all academics will adapt equally to this method. To address this, it could be beneficial to provide alternative strategies for those who might find this approach challenging.

> To address the potential weakness in the "Daily Notes" lesson, it's important to acknowledge and cater to the diverse needs and preferences of academics. Recognizing that not every academic will adapt equally to a daily note-taking habit, the course could offer alternative strategies. These might include tips for visual organization, such as mind mapping for those who think more spatially, or audio notes for those who articulate ideas better verbally. Additionally, integrating technology, like note-taking apps with reminders or collaboration features, could offer flexibility and appeal to different learning and working styles. By providing a range of options, the course can be more inclusive and effective for a wider audience, ensuring that everyone can find a method that resonates with their individual workflow and cognitive preferences.

**Case Study Suggestion**: A short case study could involve an academic struggling to balance research and teaching responsibilities, who finds that daily note-taking helps prioritize tasks and reduces cognitive overload.

**Alternate Activities**: Other activities might include setting specific times for note-taking or using digital tools for note organization.

> In addition to setting specific times for daily note-taking, which encourages a routine, another effective activity could involve the use of digital tools for note organization. This activity can be tailored to demonstrate how different apps or software can aid in efficiently categorizing and retrieving notes. Participants could be encouraged to explore and compare various digital tools, finding one that best suits their needs. This approach not only introduces them to modern organizational technologies but also allows for customization according to their personal preferences and work style, making the task of daily note-taking more manageable and effective.

**Additional Advice**: To make the lesson more engaging, interactive elements like a daily note-taking challenge or sharing notes in a community forum could be included.

# Lesson 2: Temporary

**Weaknesses and Solutions**: A potential weakness is the risk of accumulating too many temporary notes, leading to clutter. A solution could be to include strategies for regular review and cleanup of these notes, ensuring they are either actioned or discarded timely.

> To mitigate the risk of accumulating too many temporary notes, it is crucial to establish a regular review and cleanup routine. This could be incorporated into the lesson by emphasizing the importance of setting aside a specific time each week to go through temporary notes. During this review, the academic can decide which notes should be integrated into their ongoing projects, which ones should be stored for future reference, and which ones can be discarded. This process not only helps in keeping the notes organized but also ensures that no important ideas or tasks are overlooked. Such a routine becomes a critical component of effective information management, aligning with the course's aim of fostering sustainable academic practices.

**Case Study Suggestion**: A case study could involve an academic who often loses track of spontaneous ideas and tasks, but by using temporary notes, they are able to capture these effectively and integrate them into their workflow, improving organization and productivity.

**Alternate Activities**: As an alternative, incorporating a digital tool that can automatically categorize and remind about the temporary notes could be suggested. This can help in streamlining the process for busy academics.

> An effective alternative activity could involve the use of a digital tool that automatically categorizes and sends reminders about temporary notes. This would streamline the process for busy academics by providing an easy way to manage fleeting thoughts and tasks. Participants could be encouraged to explore tools with features like automatic categorization, integration with calendars for reminders, and cloud syncing for accessibility. This hands-on activity not only introduces them to modern note-organizing technology but also demonstrates how to incorporate these tools into their daily workflow, making the management of temporary notes more efficient and less time-consuming.

# Lesson 3: Literature

**Weaknesses and Solutions**: A potential weakness is the risk of literature notes becoming too cumbersome or detailed. To address this, the course could suggest concise summarization techniques and emphasize the importance of selecting only the most critical insights.

> To prevent literature notes from becoming overly cumbersome or detailed, the lesson can emphasize concise summarization techniques. This includes methods like distilling complex ideas into simple bullet points, focusing on key themes or arguments, and using mind maps to visually organize main concepts. Additionally, it's important to highlight the skill of selecting only the most pivotal insights or ideas from the readings. These strategies ensure that literature notes remain manageable and effective as tools for synthesis and recall, rather than becoming overwhelming repositories of information.

**Case Study Suggestion**: A case study could feature an academic who initially struggles to retain key insights from readings, but after adopting the practice of literature notes, sees a significant improvement in recall and application of concepts in their work.

**Alternate Activities**: Alternative activities could include collaborative literature note-making where participants share and discuss their notes, fostering a deeper understanding through peer learning.

> An alternate activity to enhance the literature notes lesson could involve collaborative note-making and peer discussions. This activity would encourage participants to share their literature notes in small groups or forums, fostering peer-to-peer learning. Such collaboration not only helps in diversifying perspectives but also allows participants to critique and refine their note-taking approaches. This method can lead to deeper understanding and engagement with the material, as participants benefit from the collective insights and approaches of their peers, making the learning experience more dynamic and comprehensive.

**Additional Advice**: To enhance engagement, the lesson could include interactive elements like a forum for sharing literature notes or group discussions on best practices in note-taking.

# Lesson 4: Project

**Weaknesses and Solutions**: A potential weakness is the assumption that one note-taking method will suit all types of projects. To address this, the course could offer varied templates or examples for different kinds of projects, catering to a wider range of academic work.

> To address the diversity of project types in academic work, the lesson on project notes could include a variety of templates and examples tailored to different project scenarios. This approach would provide flexibility and relevance for various academic disciplines and project complexities. For instance, a template for research projects might focus on methodology and data analysis, while a template for collaborative teaching projects could emphasize timelines and roles. By offering a range of structured note formats, the lesson can cater to the unique needs of different projects, ensuring that academics can find a system that resonates with their specific project management requirements.

**Case Study Suggestion**: A case study could illustrate an academic juggling multiple projects, who finds that using structured notes helps in keeping track of tasks, deadlines, and collaboration, leading to more efficient project management.

**Alternate Activities**: An alternate activity could include a peer-review system where participants share and critique each other’s project notes for enhanced organization and effectiveness.

**Additional Advice**: To make the lesson more engaging, interactive elements like a project management tool comparison or group discussions on effective project note-taking strategies could be included.

> To enhance the engagement and practicality of the lesson on project notes, incorporating interactive elements like a comparison of various project management tools can be highly beneficial. This would involve exploring different software and apps, discussing their features, and how they can be integrated into note-taking practices. Additionally, facilitating group discussions where participants can share and learn from each other's strategies in project note-taking would enrich the learning experience. These discussions could cover topics like effective organization, task prioritization, and collaborative note-sharing, providing a platform for peer learning and idea exchange.

# Lesson 5: Permanent

**Weaknesses and Solutions**: A potential weakness is the risk of information overload. To address this, the course could emphasize the importance of selecting only the most significant and timeless ideas to transform into permanent notes.

> To address the risk of information overload in creating permanent notes, the lesson should emphasize the critical skill of discernment in choosing which ideas to record. This involves guiding academics in identifying concepts that are not only relevant to their current research interests but also have the potential for long-term value and application. The lesson could include strategies for evaluating the significance and timelessness of ideas, such as checking their relevance to ongoing academic debates or their potential for cross-disciplinary application. This approach ensures that permanent notes remain focused, valuable, and manageable, aligning with the course's goal of building sustainable academic practices.

**Case Study Suggestion**: A case study could feature an academic who successfully uses permanent notes to develop a groundbreaking theory over several years, illustrating the value of this long-term note-taking approach.

**Alternate Activities**: As an alternative, participants could be encouraged to review their existing notes periodically to identify potential permanent notes, fostering a habit of reflective practice.

> An effective alternative activity for the lesson on permanent notes could involve a periodic review of existing notes to identify potential candidates for permanent notes. This activity encourages participants to engage in reflective practice, revisiting their past notes to evaluate their long-term relevance and significance. Through this process, academics can develop a deeper understanding of their evolving research interests and intellectual journey. This not only aids in the thoughtful selection of ideas for permanent notes but also fosters a habit of continuous learning and self-reflection, crucial for academic growth.

**Additional Advice**: To make the lesson more engaging, incorporating examples of successful permanent notes from renowned academics could be inspiring, along with interactive discussions on how these notes have evolved over time.

# Case study

I'd like you to write me a case study of about 1000 words that clearly describes all the issues around note-taking presented at the start of each lesson. I'd like you to describe how the subject of the case study implements the suggested strategy to not only overcome their note-taking problems, but to also grow as an academic and scholar. In this case study, the subject is an international student and PhD candidate who has recently started on his journey in a new country. He is committed to doing a good job with this research project and has great support from his supervisors and mentors. However, he is struggling with the operational tasks of just keeping up with all the different kinds of notes he needs to keep in order to manage all the various aspects of a PhD-level project, as well as the different aspects of his personal life. His coursework and lectures don't help him figure how where, how, and why to capture certain kinds of information. This case study should demonstrate how his personal and professional life might be enhanced if he could make more effective use of the different notes he finds himself taking. You could also include an emphasis on growth and development, rather than a pure focus on improving efficiency.
