> If you’re going to take notes on something, you might as well treat them as important. - Sönke Ahrens (2017)

**I used to think that taking notes was peripheral to my work; now I think that notes _are_ the work**. My notes are where I spend the majority of time in my working day. But, when you don’t differentiate between different kinds of notes, it can be difficult to work with them in different ways. The note you take as a reminder to call someone is different to the note you take in a meeting, which is different to the note that forms the starting point of an article. And yet, most people don’t have a conceptual framework for working with notes. In addition, notes are scattered across different apps, Word documents, Google Docs, draft emails, to do lists, project management apps, reference managers, work diaries, and scraps of paper. This fragmentation of your notes is, in a literal sense, also a fragmentation of your thinking.

**Aim and objectives**

By the end of this course, you should have a note-taking system that you use to get ideas out of your mind, and that provides a framework for working more effectively with them.

The objectives of this course are to:

1. Establish a habit of writing daily notes.
2. Use temporary notes to capture fleeting information.
3. Write literature notes as part of your reading process.
4. Structure projects through notes.
5. Create notes that you will keep for a lifetime.
