# Writing assistance

## Lesson overview

**Objective:** Apply functional application literacy to writing whilst developing critical evaluation skills for preserving voice—completing the substitution stage of AI literacy development

**Time to complete:** 60-65 minutes

**What you'll do:** Learn to use AI as a writing assistant while maintaining your distinctive scholarly voice through rigorous critical selection

**Progress:** Section 1 of 12

## The contrast

Dr. James Chen needs to email his research collaborator about a methodological concern. He opens a blank document. Types: "I wanted to discuss the sampling approach." Deletes it. Too formal. Types: "Hey, quick question about the methodology." Too casual. Deletes it.

Twenty minutes later, he's still staring at the opening paragraph. Finally sends something that doesn't quite say what he meant. Total time: 35 minutes. Still unsatisfied.

Dr. Elena Martinez has a similar email to write. She spends 3 minutes creating a structured prompt asking AI to draft an email explaining a methodological concern to a colleague. AI generates a draft. She then spends 7 minutes revising:

- Removes "It is important to note that..." (too formulaic)
- Changes "recent discussions" to "our conversation last Tuesday" (specific context)
- Replaces "this approach may present challenges" with "I'm worried this sampling method won't capture seasonal variation" (direct, in her voice)
- Adds example from their shared pilot study (specific knowledge AI couldn't have)

She sends it confidently. Total time: 10 minutes. Says exactly what she wanted.

> [!question] Before we begin
> Think about your last difficult writing task. What made it challenging? Where did you get stuck?

## AI as writing assistant, not writer

You've used AI for content creation (lesson 3) and reading (lesson 4). The same principle applies to writing—AI assists with specific tasks while you maintain control through critical selection.

**The crucial distinction:** AI as assistant versus AI as writer. AI drafts options, you select critically. AI suggests revisions, you decide what fits. AI generates alternatives, you choose what sounds like you. Your voice, judgement, and intellectual work remain central.

Your distinctive voice comes not from what AI generates but from what you choose to keep, how you adapt it, and what you reject as not fitting your writing. This critical selection is where ethical awareness (maintaining scholarly integrity) and critical evaluation (recognising what's actually better) intersect.

**This lesson completes the substitution stage.** You'll use AI for bounded writing tasks—drafting support, clarity improvements, alternative phrasings—whilst maintaining the voice that makes your writing yours. This is instrumental efficiency: getting unstuck faster, revising more efficiently, whilst preserving what matters most.

> [!example]- What comes after substitution
>
> You've now completed five lessons developing substitution-level literacy: recognising when AI is relevant, communicating effectively, applying across domains (content creation, reading, writing), and critically evaluating whether it serves your goals.
>
> The next stage is **adaptation**—where your practice begins reshaping around AI capabilities. You'll learn to use AI not just for bounded tasks but for developing competence in new areas, approaching problems differently, and enabling work that wasn't previously possible.
>
> Adaptation requires the functional competence and critical evaluation skills you've built through substitution. Literacy develops through stages, not leaps.

> [!question] Quick reflection
> What makes your writing recognisably yours—word choices, sentence rhythm, how you explain ideas?

## Voice calibration: Establishing your baseline

Before using AI for writing assistance, you need to calibrate—understanding what "your voice" actually sounds like and what happens when AI changes it.

**Time required:** 5 minutes

Find a paragraph from something you've written recently that sounds distinctively like you—an email, paper section, anything where you think "yes, that's my writing."

> [!todo]- Voice calibration exercise
> **Paste your paragraph here:**
>
> **Now ask AI to "improve clarity" of that paragraph.**
>
> **Compare the two versions:**
>
> **What changed that you'd keep? (genuine improvements)**
>
> **What changed that loses your voice? (generic AI patterns)**
>
> **Which specific phrases feel like "you" vs "generic academic"?**

**Calibration insight:** This exercise shows you what AI does to your voice. Notice patterns: Does AI make you more formal? Remove specific examples? Add formulaic phrases? This awareness is essential for critical evaluation when using AI for new writing.

**✓ You can now recognise your distinctive voice and how AI affects it**

**Progress:** Section 4 of 12

## Workflow 1: Getting unstuck on drafting

The hardest part of writing is often starting. AI can help overcome blank page paralysis while you maintain control over what you ultimately write.

### Faded practice: From observation to independence

**Stage 1: Observe expert application**

Here's how an experienced academic uses AI to overcome writer's block while preserving voice:

**[Initial prompt]** "Draft an email to my department head explaining that I need to postpone my teaching observation due to a research deadline. Key points: apologise for short notice, explain the deadline is external and inflexible, suggest two alternative dates next week, emphasise I value the observation process. Tone: professional but friendly—we have a good working relationship."

**[AI generates draft]**

**[Critical revision with annotations]**

Original AI: "I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you..." → Revised: "I hope you're well. I need to ask about rescheduling..." (Less formal opening, matches their relationship)

Original AI: "Due to unforeseen circumstances relating to my research obligations..." → Revised: "The journal wants final revisions by Friday—I didn't anticipate..." (Specific, not vague)

Original AI: "I would be grateful if we could identify a mutually convenient time..." → Revised: "Would either Tuesday or Thursday morning next week work for you?" (Direct, with specific options)

**Notice:**

- Kept: Email structure, professional framework
- Changed: Every sentence to match voice, added specific details, removed formulaic phrases

> [!question] Self-explanation
> Why did the revision change "unforeseen circumstances" to "journal wants final revisions by Friday"?

> [!example]- Show answer
>
> Specificity replaces vagueness. "Unforeseen circumstances" is generic AI phrasing that could mean anything. The specific deadline shows respect by explaining the actual situation. Your voice emerges from being direct and specific rather than vaguely formal.

**Stage 2: Apply to your work**

Think of a routine email or paragraph you need to write. Create a structured prompt that gives AI enough context to draft something useful.

> [!todo]- Your prompt
> **Your prompt (be specific about tone, audience, key points):**
>
> **After AI responds, revise systematically:**
>
> **Pass 1 - Structure:** What organizational elements work? (Keep these)
> **Pass 2 - Voice:** Which sentences sound like you? (Keep), which don't? (Rewrite)
> **Pass 3 - Specifics:** Where can you replace generic phrasing with specific examples?
>
> **Your revised version:**

**Self-check:**

- [ ] I revised at least 70% of AI's draft
- [ ] Final text sounds like me when read aloud
- [ ] I removed generic academic phrases
- [ ] I added context AI couldn't know

**When this works well:**

- Routine correspondence with clear information
- Overcoming blank page paralysis
- Administrative updates or summaries

**When you need to write from scratch:**

- Sensitive communications requiring careful tone
- Core arguments with your specific examples
- Anything where relationship context matters deeply

**✓ You can now use AI to overcome writer's block while maintaining your voice**

**Progress:** Section 5 of 12

## Workflow 2: Clarity improvements

Once you have draft text, AI can identify unclear passages. You then critically evaluate whether suggested improvements preserve precision while increasing clarity.

### The approach

**Prompt structure:**

"Review this paragraph for clarity. Identify sentences that are unclear or unnecessarily complex. For each, explain why it's problematic and suggest a clearer alternative. [Paste your paragraph]"

**Critical evaluation (most important step):**

- Does simpler version lose important nuance?
- Does it sound like you?
- What actually improves clarity vs what makes it bland?

**Remember:** Complexity isn't automatically bad. Sometimes ideas are genuinely complex and clarity requires precision, not simplification.

### Quick practice

Take a paragraph from something you're currently writing—something you're not quite happy with.

> [!todo]- Clarity improvement practice
> **Your original paragraph:**
>
> **Ask AI to review for clarity, then evaluate each suggestion:**
>
> **AI suggestion 1:**
>
> - What AI suggested: [___]
> - Your evaluation: Improves clarity / Loses nuance / Wrong tone
> - Decision: Keep / Reject / Modify
>
> **AI suggestion 2:**
>
> - What AI suggested: [___]
> - Your evaluation: Improves clarity / Loses nuance / Wrong tone
> - Decision: Keep / Reject / Modify
>
> **Your final revised paragraph (after critical evaluation):**

**Self-check:**

- [ ] I evaluated each suggestion individually
- [ ] I rejected suggestions that lost necessary precision
- [ ] Final version is clearer AND sounds like me
- [ ] I can explain why each change (or non-change) improves the paragraph

**Literacy note:** Critical evaluation means recognising the difference between necessary complexity (serving precision) and unnecessary complexity (serving no purpose). This is scholarly judgement that AI can't replace.

**Typical time saved:** Self-editing a paragraph: 10-15 minutes. With AI highlighting specific issues: 5-7 minutes.

**✓ You can now evaluate clarity suggestions critically**

**Progress:** Section 6 of 12

## Workflow 3: Generating alternative phrasings

When you've used the same phrase repeatedly or can't find the right wording, AI generates alternatives you select from critically.

> [!example]- The alternative phrasing workflow
>
> ### Prompt structure
>
> "I keep using the phrase '[your repeated phrase]' in this section. Suggest 5 alternative ways to express this idea, maintaining the same level of formality and precision."
>
> ### Critical selection
>
> Review all options:
>
> - Which maintains your meaning exactly?
> - Which sounds like you?
> - Often, none work perfectly, but they help you think of your own better version
>
> ### The value
>
> This is cognitive extension—AI expands your options, you make the scholarly judgement. The value isn't in AI's specific suggestions but in how they prompt your own thinking.

### Quick practice

Identify a phrase you've used repeatedly in something you're writing, or a phrase you're stuck on.

> [!todo]- Alternative phrasing practice
> **Your repeated phrase:** [___]
>
> **Ask AI for 5 alternatives. List them:**
>
> 1. [___]
> 2. [___]
> 3. [___]
> 4. [___]
> 5. [___]
>
> **Evaluate each:**
>
> - Which (if any) maintains your exact meaning?
> - Which sound like something you'd write?
> - Do they spark your own better alternative?
>
> **Your final choice (yours or AI's):**
>
> **Reasoning for your choice:**

**✓ You can now use AI to expand your phrasing options while maintaining precision**

**Progress:** Section 7 of 12

## Voice preservation exercises

The most important skill for AI-assisted writing is recognising and preserving your distinctive voice. Let's practice identifying generic patterns versus distinctive writing.

### Exercise 1: Spot the generic phrases

Read this paragraph and identify which phrases are generic AI patterns vs distinctive scholarly voice:

"It is important to note that recent research has revealed significant patterns in the data. Furthermore, this analysis suggests that the implications are particularly noteworthy. My interviews with teachers showed three unexpected disruptions in their daily routines. Moreover, these findings indicate substantial variation across different school contexts."

**Mark each phrase:**

- [ ] "It is important to note that..." → Generic / Distinctive
- [ ] "recent research has revealed..." → Generic / Distinctive
- [ ] "Furthermore, this analysis suggests..." → Generic / Distinctive
- [ ] "My interviews with teachers showed three unexpected..." → Generic / Distinctive
- [ ] "Moreover, these findings indicate..." → Generic / Distinctive
- [ ] "substantial variation across different school contexts" → Generic / Distinctive

> [!example]- Show answers
>
> **Generic AI patterns (reject these):**
>
> - "It is important to note that..." (formulaic opening, says nothing)
> - "Furthermore, this analysis suggests..." (vague transition, no substance)
> - "Moreover, these findings indicate..." (generic connector)
>
> **Distinctive voice (preserve these):**
>
> - "My interviews with teachers showed three unexpected..." (specific ownership, concrete claim)
> - "substantial variation across different school contexts" (precise, specific)
> - "recent research has revealed" is borderline—generic phrasing but not empty

### Exercise 2: Revision challenge

Here's a paragraph written in generic AI style. Revise it to sound like academic writing with voice:

"It is evident that the educational landscape has undergone significant transformation. Furthermore, it can be argued that these changes have had considerable impact on teaching practices. Moreover, recent studies suggest that educators have adapted their approaches accordingly. This development is particularly noteworthy in the context of contemporary pedagogical frameworks."

> [!todo] Your revision
> Revise the paragraph above (same content, your voice):

**Compare to this example revision:**

"Teaching has changed fundamentally over the past decade. Thompson's 2023 study shows teachers now spend 40% more time on assessment than on instruction—a shift that transforms their daily work. My interviews with fifteen secondary teachers reveal they've developed three distinct strategies for managing this tension between evaluation and pedagogy."

**What makes the example revision stronger?**

- Specific rather than vague ("40% more time" vs "significant transformation")
- Active rather than passive voice ("teachers spend" vs "has undergone")
- Ownership and evidence ("My interviews" vs "recent studies suggest")
- Concrete over abstract ("assessment vs instruction" vs "contemporary frameworks")

**✓ You can now identify and reject generic AI patterns**

## Decision point: When to use AI for writing

Not every writing task benefits from AI assistance. Let's practice recognising when AI helps versus when it hinders.

### The scenario

You need to write a difficult email to a colleague who missed an important deadline for your joint grant application. This delay means you have only 2 days instead of 2 weeks to finalise the budget section.

**What's your approach?**

<details> <summary><strong>Option A: Use AI to draft the entire email</strong></summary>

**Your approach:** You prompt AI: "Draft an email to a colleague who missed a deadline, explaining the impact on our grant application."

**What happens:** AI produces professionally phrased text: "I wanted to touch base regarding the recent project timeline. It would be beneficial to discuss our mutual commitments moving forward. Perhaps we could identify strategies to ensure alignment..."

You send it. Your colleague responds coldly—the tone feels formal and passive-aggressive. Your normally collegial relationship feels strained. They're defensive rather than apologetic.

**Time total:** 5 minutes writing, weeks repairing relationship

**Learning:** AI can't know relationship context. Sensitive communications requiring careful tone balance need to be written by you from the start. AI's generic "professional" tone often reads as cold or passive-aggressive in real relationships.

</details> <details> <summary><strong>Option B: Write it entirely yourself without AI</strong></summary>

**Your approach:** You spend 30 minutes drafting and revising, trying to balance expressing frustration with maintaining the relationship. The emotional labor is exhausting. You're not sure if you got the tone right.

**What happens:** The email works—your colleague apologises, explains what happened, commits to the revised timeline. The relationship is fine. But the writing process was draining.

**Time total:** 30 minutes of emotionally taxing work

**Learning:** You did it well, but this timing wasn't optimal for AI assistance. AI could have helped with structure while you provided all the relationship-sensitive content.

</details> <details> <summary><strong>Option C: Use AI for structure only, write sensitive content yourself</strong></summary>

**Your approach:** You ask AI: "Suggest a structure for an email addressing a missed deadline while maintaining collegial relationship. I need to: acknowledge impact, understand what happened, find solution together."

AI suggests framework:

1. Express concern about the situation (not blame)
2. Explain concrete impact (short timeline now)
3. Ask what happened (genuine question)
4. Propose path forward collaboratively

You write each section yourself using this structure: "I'm worried about our budget section timeline—we're now down to 2 days instead of 2 weeks, which is tight. What happened on your end? Let's talk today about how we can divide this work to still submit something strong."

**Time total:** 15 minutes (3 min structure, 12 min writing)

**Learning:** AI provided structural scaffolding while you handled all relationship-sensitive content. This balanced efficiency with authenticity. The structure helped you be direct and solution-focused rather than dwelling on frustration.

</details>

**Reflection:** When should you use AI for writing? When should you write entirely yourself?

[Text input box]

**Decision principle:** Use AI for structure and routine content; write sensitive, relationship-dependent, or core intellectual content yourself. Don't let AI handle tone when relationships matter.

## Read aloud practice: The voice preservation test

Reading your writing aloud is the single best test for voice preservation. Let's practice this systematically.

**Time required:** 5 minutes

Take something you've written today using AI assistance (from the previous exercises).

**Read it aloud slowly, listening for:**

### Voice preservation checklist

While reading, mark each:

**Natural language check:**

- [ ] This sounds like conversation I'd have (even if formal)
- [ ] No phrases I'd never say aloud
- [ ] Sentence rhythm matches how I think

**Recognition check:**

- [ ] Colleagues who know my writing would recognise this
- [ ] Uses words I actually use
- [ ] Examples are specific to my work
- [ ] Explanations match how I teach/talk about ideas

**Generic phrase check:**

- [ ] No "It is important to note that..."
- [ ] No "Furthermore" or "Moreover" without substance
- [ ] No passive constructions hiding agency ("It can be argued...")
- [ ] No vague intensifiers ("particularly significant," "especially noteworthy")

### If you found problems:

**List phrases that don't sound like you:**

1. [___]
2. [___]
3. [___]

**Revise them now:**

1. [___]
2. [___]
3. [___]

**Literacy note:** This read-aloud practice trains your ear to recognise when AI has influenced your voice. With practice, you'll catch these patterns during writing rather than needing a separate review pass.

**✓ You can now test voice preservation systematically**

**Progress:** Section 10 of 12

## Voice retention metric: Measuring revision depth

Voice preservation isn't just subjective feeling—you can measure how much you revise AI drafts.

**Calculate your voice retention score:**

For any text where you used AI assistance:

1. **Count total sentences in final version:** [___]
2. **Count sentences kept completely unchanged from AI draft:** [___]
3. **Calculate percentage:** (unchanged ÷ total) × 100 = [___]%

### Interpreting your score

**10-30% unchanged: Healthy range**

- You're using AI for structure/drafting support
- Heavy revision preserves your voice
- This is effective AI-assisted writing

**30-50% unchanged: Moderate voice risk**

- Check carefully by reading aloud
- Verify phrases sound like you
- May indicate accepting AI phrasing too readily

**Over 50% unchanged: Voice likely compromised**

- Generic AI prose probably dominates
- Requires more aggressive revision
- Consider whether AI helped or just produced text you accepted

**Under 10% unchanged: AI may not have helped**

- If almost complete rewrite, might have been faster to write yourself
- AI assistance added overhead rather than value
- Some tasks don't benefit from AI drafting

### Your score from today's exercises

**Exercise:** [which one] **Unchanged percentage:** [___]% **Assessment:** Healthy / Moderate risk / Compromised / Unhelpful

**What this tells you about your revision practice:**

### What didn't work

**AI was not helpful for:**

Task type: [_**]  
Why it added friction: [**_]  
What I needed instead: [_**]  
What I learned: [**_]

### Pattern recognition

Looking across today's exercises, identify patterns:

**Task characteristics that work well with AI:**

### This week's commitment

**I will:**

- Try AI for ONE more writing task this week
- Apply the 4-pass revision strategy (structure → examples → voice → read aloud)
- Calculate my voice retention percentage
- Document whether it helped or hindered

**Specific task:** [___]

**Day/time I'll do this:** [___]

**Calendar entry created:** Yes / Not yet

**Literacy note:** Both successes and failures build taste. If AI hinders more than helps for certain writing tasks, that's valuable knowledge about your process.

## Key takeaways

### AI as assistant requires critical selection

AI as writing assistant means you maintain control over voice, argument, and quality through rigorous critical selection. AI drafts options, you select what works, reject what doesn't, and revise everything to sound like you. Your distinctive voice comes from what you choose to keep, how you adapt it, and what you reject. This critical evaluation process is where your voice and scholarly judgement reside—not in AI's initial draft.

### Voice preservation distinguishes literacy from competence

Many people can get AI to draft text. Fewer develop the critical evaluation skills to recognise what preserves versus compromises their distinctive voice. This requires ethical awareness (maintaining scholarly integrity), critical evaluation (distinguishing genuine improvements from generic alternatives), and contextual judgement (knowing when your voice matters more than efficiency). These dimensions develop through practice with honest assessment, not through following rules.

### Read aloud to catch generic patterns

Reading your writing aloud is the single best test for voice preservation. Your ear catches formulaic phrases, awkward rhythm, and generic academic prose that your eyes miss. Make this systematic: read every AI-assisted piece aloud, mark phrases that don't sound like you, revise them immediately. With practice, you'll catch these patterns during writing rather than needing separate review.

### Substitution works for bounded tasks, not core intellectual work

Substitution-level writing support works for routine correspondence, overcoming blank page paralysis, clarity improvements on existing text, and generating alternative phrasings. It works less well for core arguments requiring your specific examples, sensitive communications needing careful relationship-aware tone, and complex scholarly claims where precision matters more than efficiency. Recognising this distinction is contextual judgement—understanding when AI serves your goals.

## Moving beyond substitution

**You've completed the substitution stage.** Across five lessons, you've developed recognition (understanding what AI is), functional application (communicating effectively), applied competence (using AI for content creation, reading, writing), critical evaluation (honest assessment), and beginning taste (pattern recognition about meaningful engagement).

**What comes next: Adaptation**

The next lessons move beyond substitution to adaptation—where your practice begins reshaping around AI capabilities. You'll learn to:

- Use AI not just for bounded tasks but for developing competence in new areas
- Approach complex problems differently because AI enables new methods
- Build sustained AI partnerships that accumulate understanding over time
- Make sophisticated contextual judgements about when to reshape practice

Adaptation requires the functional competence and critical evaluation you've built through substitution. You can't thoughtfully reshape practice without first developing baseline competence. Literacy develops through stages, not leaps.
