# Assessing the course against AI literacy

This analysis maps the 11-lesson AI for Academics course against the six dimensions of [[AI literacy]], which applies the [[common architecture of literacy]] to artificial intelligence engagement.

## Mapping course sections to literacy domains

### Access and recognition

**Course sections**: Foundation lessons 1-2

The course establishes AI as language-based cognitive extension rather than tool, search engine, or database. It teaches participants to recognise AI capabilities and limitations, understand when AI is present and useful, and identify appropriate contexts for engagement. This directly addresses the access and recognition dimension by helping academics understand what AI actually is and when it is relevant to their work.

### Critical evaluation

**Course sections**: Throughout, especially Transformation lesson 2

The course repeatedly emphasises verification, critical evaluation of outputs, understanding complementary errors (where humans and AI make different mistakes), and recognising hallucinations and limitations. The "cultivating taste" lesson explicitly teaches evaluative judgement about AI engagement quality. This delivers the critical evaluation dimension by building systematic approaches to assessing AI outputs and processes.

### Functional application

**Course sections**: Substitution and Adaptation lessons

The course provides extensive practical training across multiple domains: content creation, reading for information, writing assistance, building competence, argument development, and problem decomposition. Participants learn structured prompting, iterative engagement, and domain-specific application across research, teaching, and administration. This comprehensively addresses functional application by teaching operational competence in context.

### Creation and communication

**Course sections**: Adaptation lessons, Transformation lesson 1

The course moves beyond consumption to creation—using AI to develop arguments, decompose problems, generate research questions, and produce scholarly outputs. The context sovereignty lesson teaches building persistent AI partnerships that enable ongoing creation. This dimension is strongly developed through the progression from substitution (AI does tasks) to adaptation (reshaping practice) to transformation (structural integration).

### Ethical awareness and responsibility

**Course sections**: Throughout

The course addresses transparency, attribution, verification as shared responsibility, avoiding over-reliance, understanding when AI undermines rather than supports goals, and maintaining scholarly voice and integrity. While not organised as a standalone "ethics module," ethical considerations are woven throughout practical lessons, appearing where they are most relevant to actual decisions.

### Contextual judgement and metacognition

**Course sections**: Transformation lessons 2-3

The "cultivating taste" lesson explicitly develops professional judgement about meaningful engagement versus superficial efficiency. The course teaches participants to distinguish genuine competence from familiarity, recognise when AI helps versus hinders, evaluate both outputs and processes, and develop domain-specific taste. The "integrating into practice" lesson provides frameworks for ongoing reflection and adaptation. This addresses the metacognitive dimension by making judgement development an explicit learning objective.

## Summary mapping

| Literacy dimension | Primary course sections |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Access and recognition | Foundation 1-2 |
| Critical evaluation | Throughout, esp. Transformation 2 |
| Functional application | Substitution, Adaptation |
| Creation and communication | Adaptation, Transformation 1 |
| Ethical awareness | Integrated throughout |
| Contextual judgement | Transformation 2-3 |

## The verdict

Someone who completes this course with genuine engagement would be AI literate according to the multidimensional framework. The course explicitly addresses all six dimensions of literacy, with particular strength in the dimensions that distinguish literate from merely competent users: critical evaluation and contextual judgement.

The progression from substitution through adaptation to transformation mirrors the progression from novice to expert across literacy frameworks. Substitution develops functional competence. Adaptation develops critical evaluation and creative application. Transformation develops contextual judgement and metacognitive awareness.

This structural alignment with literacy frameworks—whether intentional or emergent—is what makes the course capable of delivering AI literacy rather than just AI skills.

*Note: We also need to bear in mind that any claims with respect to developing AI literacy are accompanied with certain [[content/Notes/qualifications for AI literacy.md|qualifications]].*

## The distinctive contribution

What makes this course particularly effective at developing AI literacy is its refusal to treat AI integration as purely technical. Many "AI for academics" courses focus primarily on the functional application dimension (here is how to write prompts, here is how to use AI for X task) with ethics bolted on at the end.

This course integrates all six dimensions throughout. More importantly, it emphasises the two dimensions that distinguish literate from merely competent users: critical evaluation and contextual judgement. The course explicitly teaches participants to develop taste—professional judgement that cannot be reduced to rules but develops through reflective practice.
