# Developing AI literacy for academic practice

**A comprehensive course for building multidimensional capability with generative AI**

---

## The literacy you need for an AI-integrated world

Everyone's talking about generative AI in higher education. Most conversations focus on what students might do with ChatGPT, whether AI threatens academic integrity, or how universities should regulate these tools.

But there's a more fundamental question that's not being asked: **what does it mean to be AI literate as an academic?**

You're already stretched thin. Teaching preparation, marking, email, administration, grant applications, and somehow finding time for research. The sector's response to AI has been characteristically reactive—creating policies before understanding what they're regulating, managing anxiety before exploring possibility.

Meanwhile, you're left wondering whether these tools could actually help your work, or whether engaging with AI means compromising your scholarly standards.

**This course takes a different approach.** Rather than treating AI as a threat to manage or a tool to master, it positions AI literacy as a core professional capability—one that integrates critical thinking, practical competence, ethical awareness, and professional judgement.

By the end of this course, you won't just know how to use AI tools. You'll have developed the multidimensional literacy that enables you to engage with AI critically, effectively, and responsibly across all aspects of your academic practice.

## What AI literacy actually means

AI literacy isn't about learning software. It's not about memorising prompts or following templates. It's about developing integrated capability across six interconnected dimensions:

**Access and recognition:** Understanding when and where AI is relevant to your work, and how to engage with different AI capabilities appropriately.

**Critical evaluation:** Assessing AI outputs for quality, reliability, and limitations, while understanding your complementary role in collaborative quality control.

**Functional application:** Using AI effectively across diverse academic contexts, from reading and writing to teaching and research.

**Creation and communication:** Generating meaningful scholarly outputs through AI collaboration while maintaining your distinctive voice and intellectual contribution.

**Ethical awareness:** Understanding the implications of AI use for academic integrity, intellectual property, and scholarly values.

**Contextual judgement:** Developing professional taste about when AI enhances your work versus when it undermines it—the metacognitive capability that distinguishes literate from merely competent users.

This course systematically develops all six dimensions through practical application to your actual academic work.

## How the course works

### The three-stage learning progression

The course uses a developmental framework that mirrors how expertise develops across all literacy domains: from basic competence through adaptation to transformation.

**Foundation: Understanding AI as cognitive partner**

Before engaging practically with AI, you need conceptual foundations that shape all subsequent work. These lessons establish what AI actually is (language-based cognitive extension), how to approach it (as collaborative partner rather than tool), and how to communicate effectively with it.

**Stage 1: Substitution (adding efficiency to existing practice)**

Substitution focuses on integrating AI into your current workflows to accomplish routine tasks faster. You develop basic functional literacy while maintaining your established practices—learning when AI actually saves time and when it creates false efficiency.

**Stage 2: Adaptation (reshaping practice around AI capabilities)**

Adaptation shifts from doing existing tasks faster to changing how work gets done. You begin reshaping your scholarly practice around AI capabilities, using AI not just for efficiency but for genuinely different approaches to building competence, developing arguments, and decomposing problems.

**Stage 3: Transformation (structural integration into practice)**

Transformation moves beyond adapting specific tasks to making AI a permanent part of your professional infrastructure. This requires developing the contextual judgement and metacognitive awareness that characterises genuine literacy—knowing when and how AI serves your goals, and when it doesn't.

### Practice-based learning

Each lesson includes:

**Real academic scenarios** showing how academics actually use AI—what works, what doesn't, and why. You'll see before-and-after comparisons demonstrating how literacy changes practice.

**Hands-on activities** using your actual work. Instead of hypothetical exercises, you'll apply concepts to your own research, teaching, and writing. Most lessons include 3-6 short practice activities (5-15 minutes each).

**Self-assessment tools** that help you calibrate your current practice and identify where literacy development will have the most impact. You'll recognize patterns in your own work and understand why certain approaches fail.

**Critical evaluation frameworks** for assessing AI outputs, recognizing when AI helps versus hinders, and developing professional judgement that transfers across contexts.

**Reflection prompts** throughout each lesson to document your developing understanding and create context for future work. These aren't busy-work—they're how literacy develops.

**Honest discussion of limitations.** You'll learn when AI creates false efficiency, when it adds overhead rather than saving time, and how to recognize meaningful engagement versus superficial assistance.

### Time investment

**11 comprehensive lessons** totalling approximately 10-12 hours of active engagement.

**Lesson length:** 40-75 minutes each, broken into manageable sections with clear progress tracking.

**Your pace:** Self-paced format allows you to work through materials when they suit your schedule, revisiting content as needed.

**Application time:** Activities use your actual academic work, so time spent isn't separate from your regular workflow—you're making progress on real projects while developing literacy.

**Realistic completion:** Most participants complete the course over 4-6 weeks, working through 2-3 lessons per week.

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need prior experience with AI tools?**  
No. The course assumes no prior AI experience and begins with conceptual foundations before moving to practical application. If you can use email and word processing software, you have the technical background you need.

**Which AI platforms does the course cover?**  
The course develops literacy that applies across different AI platforms. Examples use widely accessible tools like ChatGPT and Claude, but the frameworks transfer to any generative AI system you encounter.

**How is this different from other "AI for academics" courses?**  
Most courses focus on functional skills—here's how to write prompts, here's how to use AI for specific tasks. This course develops comprehensive literacy across six dimensions including critical evaluation and professional judgement. You're not just learning tools; you're developing integrated capability that evolves as technology changes.

**How much time should I expect to spend?**  
Most participants complete the course over 4-6 weeks, spending 2-3 hours per week on lessons and activities. The course is self-paced, so you can adjust this to fit your schedule. Activities use your actual academic work rather than requiring separate practice time.

**Are the activities mandatory?**  
The activities are where literacy develops. You can skip them and read the lessons, but you won't develop the capability the course aims to build. Literacy comes from practice, not passive reading.

**Will this add more to my already overwhelming workload?**  
The goal is the opposite—to help you manage existing workload more effectively by developing literacy that creates efficiency where it's appropriate. Activities use your actual work rather than adding separate tasks. Most participants report saving 3-5 hours per week after developing literacy.

**How do I maintain scholarly integrity and voice when using AI?**  
The course explicitly addresses this throughout. You'll learn to treat AI as cognitive collaborator that enhances your process rather than replacement for your thinking. Lessons on cultivating taste teach you to distinguish meaningful engagement from superficial efficiency that compromises quality.

**What about ethical concerns and academic honesty?**  
Ethical awareness is woven throughout the course, addressed where it's most relevant to actual decisions rather than isolated in a standalone module. You'll develop frameworks for making informed choices about AI use aligned with your professional values and institutional requirements.

**Can I apply these approaches to my teaching?**  
Yes. While the course focuses on developing your personal literacy, many strategies apply directly to developing teaching materials and supporting student learning. The literacy you develop transfers across all aspects of academic work.

**What if AI capabilities change significantly?**  
The course develops foundational literacy rather than platform-specific skills. You'll understand principles that apply regardless of which tools you use, enabling you to adapt as capabilities evolve. Course updates address major shifts in AI landscape.

**Is this suitable for academics in all disciplines?**  
Yes. The course uses examples across disciplines and teaches principles that transfer to any field. Whether you're in humanities, social sciences, STEM, or professional disciplines, you'll develop literacy applicable to your specific scholarly context.

**Do I get a certificate upon completion?**  
The course focuses on developing practical capability rather than formal credentials. What you receive is comprehensive AI literacy that changes how you work—which is more valuable than a certificate.

**What's the refund policy?**  
Complete the course materials and activities. If you don't find practical value for your academic work, request a full refund within 30 days of enrolment. No questions asked.

## Why AI literacy matters now

The integration of AI into academic work isn't hypothetical—it's happening regardless of whether institutions, departments, or individual academics feel prepared. The question isn't whether to engage with AI, but how to do so critically, effectively, and responsibly.

Without AI literacy, you're left with two unsatisfying options: avoid AI tools entirely and watch colleagues gain efficiencies you're missing, or adopt them uncritically and risk superficial engagement that undermines scholarly quality.

**AI literacy provides a third path:** thoughtful integration that enhances your scholarly practice while maintaining critical awareness, intellectual contribution, and professional standards.

The academics who thrive in AI-integrated environments won't be those who avoid the technology or adopt it uncritically. They'll be those who develop the multidimensional literacy to engage thoughtfully—understanding capabilities and limitations, applying tools effectively, creating meaningful outputs, recognizing ethical implications, and exercising professional judgement about when AI serves their goals.

That's what this course develops. That's what AI literacy means.
