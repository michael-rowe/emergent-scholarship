Course overview: Developing AI literacy for academic practice
The course develops comprehensive AI literacy through 11 lessons structured across four modules. Each lesson includes hands-on activities using your actual academic work, self-assessment tools, and frameworks for critical evaluation. You'll progress from foundational understanding through practical application to sustained integration, developing six dimensions of literacy that enable critical, effective, and responsible AI engagement.
________________


Foundation module: Building conceptual understanding
Lesson 1: Understanding AI as a cognitive partner (40-45 minutes)
Establishes what large language models actually are and why approaching them as language-based cognitive extension rather than software fundamentally changes what's possible. You'll work through incorrect mental models and develop a collaboration framework based on understanding complementary errors and shared responsibility for quality.
Lesson 2: Prompting and communication (50-55 minutes)
Teaches structured prompting as a communication practice, covering prompt anatomy, iterative refinement strategies, and context sovereignty; how to build persistent AI relationships that accumulate understanding over time. You'll learn when to invest in context development versus when simple queries suffice.

Stage 1: Substitution module
Lesson 3: Creating content efficiently (60-65 minutes)
Covers four workflows for teaching materials, presentations, assessment questions, and professional correspondence. Emphasises honest evaluation: when does AI actually save time versus adding overhead? You'll practice workflows with your own content and learn to recognise false efficiency.
Lesson 4: Reading for information (55-60 minutes)
Develops multi-level information extraction strategies for academic papers while maintaining critical reading practices. Distinguishes between information extraction (substitution-level reading) and competence building (addressed in lesson 6), teaching you when each approach serves your goals.
Lesson 5: Writing assistance (50-55 minutes)
Positions AI as writing coach for overcoming blocks, receiving feedback on structure and clarity, and collaborative drafting without losing distinctive voice. You'll practice four specific approaches and develop judgement about when each enhances versus undermines your writing process.

Stage 2: Adaptation module
Lesson 6: Building competence through reading (60-65 minutes)
Moves beyond information extraction to developing genuine working competence in unfamiliar methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Teaches deliberate complexity staging - starting accessible, adding nuance systematically - and testing understanding through application rather than recognition.
Lesson 7: Argument development through dialogue (65-75 minutes)
Develops strong arguments through systematic pre-writing exploration before committing to prose. You'll learn to test claims from multiple perspectives, surface implicit assumptions, anticipate counterarguments, and identify which evidence is necessary versus merely available. Includes self-assessment of current argument development practice.
Lesson 8: Problem decomposition (60-65 minutes)
Teaches systematic decomposition of complex academic problems - dissertation questions, research designs, interdisciplinary challenges - from multiple theoretical and methodological angles before investigating. You'll learn when decomposition adds value versus when it overcomplicates straightforward work.

Stage 3: Transformation module
Lesson 9: Context sovereignty (55-60 minutes)
Builds persistent AI partnerships with accumulated context about your research, disciplinary conventions, ongoing projects, and scholarly goals. You'll create a strategy for one specific area of your work and understand the time investment required for effective context development.
Lesson 10: Cultivating taste and evaluative judgement (65-70 minutes)
Develops professional judgement about meaningful engagement that can't be reduced to rules. Covers frameworks for systematic reflection, recognises domain-specific taste differences across research, teaching, and administration, and positions taste cultivation as ongoing professional work requiring continued attention.
Lesson 11: Sustaining AI literacy through structural integration (45 minutes)
Addresses how to make literacy practices automatic through workflow redesign rather than relying on willpower. You'll learn why good intentions fail under real-world pressures and design one concrete structural change that makes literate practice the default option requiring less effort than superficial engagement.

What you'll develop
Across these 11 lessons, you'll build integrated capability spanning six dimensions of AI literacy: access and recognition, critical evaluation, functional application, creation and communication, ethical awareness, and contextual judgement. The progression from foundation through substitution and adaptation to transformation mirrors how expertise develops across all literacy domains; from novice understanding to reflective practice.
Most importantly, you'll develop the professional judgement to distinguish meaningful AI collaboration from superficial efficiency, enabling you to enhance your scholarly practice whilst maintaining intellectual contribution and academic standards. This literacy applies regardless of which specific AI tools you use, allowing you to adapt as capabilities evolve rather than becoming dependent on particular platforms.
Total course time: 10-12 hours across 4-6 weeks, with lifetime access to all materials and future updates.
