# Developing AI literacy for academic practice: Course overview

The course provides a structured framework for academics to develop comprehensive AI literacy, moving beyond tool operation to multidimensional capability that integrates critical thinking, practical competence, ethical awareness, and professional judgement.

## Problem this course addresses

Academics face a literacy gap. Institutional responses to AI have been reactive—creating policies, managing anxiety, regulating use—but haven't developed the capability academics need to engage with AI critically and effectively. Meanwhile, academics are left with incomplete mental models: treating AI as search engine, automation tool, or threat to manage.

The result is academic overwhelm paired with uncertainty. You lack the literacy to distinguish meaningful AI engagement from superficial efficiency, to evaluate when AI enhances versus undermines scholarly work, or to integrate AI responsibly while maintaining intellectual contribution and academic standards.

This course addresses that literacy gap systematically. It develops six interconnected dimensions of AI literacy: recognising when and where AI is relevant, critically evaluating outputs and limitations, using AI effectively across contexts, creating meaningful scholarly outputs through collaboration, understanding ethical implications, and cultivating professional judgement about when AI serves your goals. This multidimensional capability—not tool training—is what enables you to navigate AI integration thoughtfully.

## Three-stage literacy development progression

The course structures learning around how expertise develops across all literacy domains: from foundational competence through sophisticated application to reflective practice.

### Stage 1: Substitution (developing foundational literacy)

Substitution establishes functional literacy—the practical ability to use AI effectively for routine academic tasks. You learn to recognise AI capabilities, communicate needs through structured prompting, and integrate AI into existing workflows for content creation, information extraction, and drafting assistance.

This stage develops access, recognition, and basic functional application. You're not changing how you work fundamentally; you're building the operational competence that enables more sophisticated engagement later.

### Stage 2: Adaptation (developing critical and creative literacy)

Adaptation moves beyond functional competence to critical evaluation and creative application. You learn to use AI for genuinely different approaches to academic work: building working competence in unfamiliar areas through deliberately staged learning, developing arguments through systematic critique from multiple perspectives, and decomposing complex problems before committing to approaches.

This stage develops the ability to assess quality, identify appropriate contexts for use, and create meaningful scholarly outputs through collaboration. Your practice begins reshaping around AI capabilities rather than simply adding efficiency to existing workflows.

### Stage 3: Transformation (developing evaluative judgement and metacognitive awareness)

Transformation addresses the dimensions that distinguish literate from merely competent users: contextual judgement and metacognitive awareness. You learn to build persistent AI partnerships with accumulated context (context sovereignty) and develop professional taste—the nuanced judgement to evaluate when and how AI serves scholarly goals that can't be reduced to rules.

This stage integrates all literacy dimensions. You're not following frameworks mechanically; you're exercising informed professional judgement that adapts to context, reflects on effectiveness, and evolves with your practice.

## What AI literacy enables

By developing comprehensive AI literacy, you achieve:

**Sustained capability that evolves with technology:** Foundational understanding of what AI is and how it works enables you to adapt as capabilities change rather than becoming dependent on specific tools or platforms. You can evaluate new AI systems critically and determine appropriate engagement independently.

**Critical integration without compromising standards:** The ability to distinguish meaningful AI collaboration from superficial efficiency that undermines scholarly quality. You maintain intellectual contribution, distinctive voice, and academic integrity while gaining genuine efficiencies where appropriate.

**Professional confidence and agency:** The knowledge, skills, and judgement to make informed decisions about AI use aligned with your professional values. You're neither avoiding AI anxiously nor adopting it uncritically—you're engaging thoughtfully based on developed literacy.

**Reclaimed cognitive resources for high-value work:** Time and mental energy freed from routine tasks can be redirected to research, teaching, mentoring, and creative scholarship that requires your expertise and can't be delegated to AI.

**Shift in professional identity:** From solitary practitioner struggling with volume and overwhelm to collaborative scholar whose competence includes guiding sophisticated intellectual partnerships with AI—a capability increasingly central to academic work.

Most fundamentally, AI literacy provides the third path between avoidance and uncritical adoption. You develop the multidimensional capability to integrate AI into your scholarly practice critically, effectively, and responsibly—enhancing your work while maintaining the standards that define academic excellence.
