# AI Literacy for Academic Practice

**Develop multidimensional capability with generative AI for academic work**

This course develops comprehensive AI literacy across six interconnected dimensions, using a developmental framework that moves from basic competence through adaptation to transformation.

## What AI literacy means

AI literacy isn't about learning software or memorizing prompts. It's about developing integrated capability across six interconnected dimensions:

- **Access and recognition:** Understanding when and where AI is relevant to your work
- **Critical evaluation:** Assessing AI outputs for quality, reliability, and limitations
- **Functional application:** Using AI effectively across diverse academic contexts
- **Creation and communication:** Generating meaningful scholarly outputs while maintaining your distinctive voice
- **Ethical awareness:** Understanding implications for academic integrity and scholarly values
- **Contextual judgement:** Developing professional taste about when AI enhances versus undermines your work

## Course structure

The course uses a three-stage developmental framework with foundation lessons and three modules:

### Foundation: Building conceptual understanding

**Lesson 1: AI as a cognitive partner** (40-45 minutes)
Understanding what large language models actually are and how to approach them as language-based cognitive extension rather than software tools. Working through common mental models and developing a collaboration framework.

**Lesson 2: Prompting and communication** (50-55 minutes)
Learning to communicate effectively with AI through structured prompting and context sovereignty. Building persistent AI relationships that accumulate understanding over time.

### Module 1: Substitution (adding efficiency to existing practice)

**Lesson 3: Creating content efficiently** (60-65 minutes)
Streamlining creation of teaching materials, presentations, assessment questions, and professional correspondence. Learning when AI actually saves time versus adding overhead.

**Lesson 4: Reading for information** (55-60 minutes)
Extracting information efficiently from academic papers while maintaining critical reading practices. Understanding the difference between information extraction and competence building.

**Lesson 5: Writing assistance** (50-55 minutes)
Using AI as writing coach for overcoming blocks, receiving feedback, and collaborative drafting without losing your distinctive voice.

### Module 2: Adaptation (reshaping practice around AI capabilities)

**Lesson 6: Building competence** (60-65 minutes)
Moving beyond information extraction to developing genuine working competence in unfamiliar methodologies and theoretical frameworks through deliberate complexity staging.

**Lesson 7: Argument development** (65-75 minutes)
Developing strong arguments through systematic pre-writing exploration—testing claims, surfacing assumptions, anticipating counterarguments before committing to prose.

**Lesson 8: Problem decomposition** (60-65 minutes)
Breaking down complex academic problems—dissertation questions, research designs, interdisciplinary challenges—from multiple theoretical and methodological angles.

### Module 3: Transformation (structural integration into practice)

**Lesson 9: Context sovereignty** (55-60 minutes)
Building persistent AI partnerships with accumulated context about your research, disciplinary conventions, ongoing projects, and scholarly goals.

**Lesson 10: Cultivating taste** (65-70 minutes)
Developing professional judgement about meaningful engagement that can't be reduced to rules. Learning frameworks for systematic reflection and domain-specific taste cultivation.

**Lesson 11: Sustaining AI literacy** (45 minutes)
Making AI literacy practices automatic through workflow redesign rather than relying on willpower. Designing structural changes that make literate practice the default.

## Learning approach

Each lesson includes:
- Real academic scenarios showing how academics actually use AI
- Hands-on activities using your actual work (3-6 short activities per lesson)
- Self-assessment tools for calibrating your current practice
- Critical evaluation frameworks for ongoing judgement development
- Honest discussion of limitations and when AI doesn't help

## What you'll develop

- Critical understanding of AI capabilities and limitations
- Practical competence across academic contexts (reading, writing, teaching, research)
- Professional judgement distinguishing meaningful engagement from superficial efficiency
- Ethical awareness for responsible practice aligned with scholarly values
- Foundational literacy that evolves as technology changes

## Who this is for

This course is designed for academics who want to develop genuine literacy rather than just learn tools, are willing to practice with actual work, value scholarly voice and integrity, and need practical approaches for real academic contexts. No prior AI experience required.
