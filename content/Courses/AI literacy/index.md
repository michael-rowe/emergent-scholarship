**Develop multidimensional capability with generative AI for academic work**

This course develops comprehensive AI literacy across six interconnected dimensions, using a developmental framework that moves from basic competence through adaptation to transformation. No prior AI experience required.

## What AI literacy means

AI literacy isn't about learning software or memorising prompts. It's about developing integrated capability across six interconnected dimensions:

- **Access and recognition:** Understanding when and where AI is relevant to your work
- **Critical evaluation:** Assessing AI outputs for quality, reliability, and limitations
- **Functional application:** Using AI effectively across diverse academic contexts
- **Creation and communication:** Generating meaningful scholarly outputs while maintaining your distinctive voice
- **Ethical awareness:** Understanding implications for academic integrity and scholarly values
- **Contextual judgement:** Developing professional taste about when AI enhances versus undermines your work

## Course structure

The course uses a developmental framework across four modules:

- **Foundation (Lessons 1-2):** Conceptual understanding of what AI is and how to communicate effectively with it
- **Substitution (Lessons 3-5):** Integrating AI into existing workflows for routine tasks
- **Adaptation (Lessons 6-8):** Reshaping practice around AI capabilities for genuinely different approaches
- **Transformation (Lessons 9-11):** Making AI a permanent part of professional infrastructure
