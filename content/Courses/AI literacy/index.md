**Develop multidimensional capability with generative AI for academic work**

This course develops comprehensive AI literacy across six interconnected dimensions, using a developmental framework that moves from basic competence through adaptation to transformation. No prior AI experience required.

## What AI literacy means

AI literacy isn't about learning software or memorising prompts. It's about developing integrated capability across six interconnected dimensions:

- **Access and recognition:** Understanding when and where AI is relevant to your work
- **Critical evaluation:** Assessing AI outputs for quality, reliability, and limitations
- **Functional application:** Using AI effectively across diverse academic contexts
- **Creation and communication:** Generating meaningful scholarly outputs while maintaining your distinctive voice
- **Ethical awareness:** Understanding implications for academic integrity and scholarly values
- **Contextual judgement:** Developing professional taste about when AI enhances versus undermines your work
