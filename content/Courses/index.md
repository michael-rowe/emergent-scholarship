<!-- Note: This index page currently lists courses manually. -->
<!-- To make it fully dynamic, a custom Quartz component could be created to: -->
<!-- 1. Scan subdirectories for course-overview.md or similar files -->
<!-- 2. Extract YAML metadata (title, description, status, etc.) -->
<!-- 3. Generate course cards automatically -->
<!-- This would be implemented in quartz/components/ as a custom component -->
