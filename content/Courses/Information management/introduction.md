  knowledge work and why developing these skills matters for your academic
  career.

> Knowledge work is really craftsmanship. It's just that what you're crafting is information and not carved wood. You're crafting ideas. You're crafting knowledge out of raw material and the more you think about it like a craftsman, the happier and more satisfied you'll be.

> Eric Barker (2014)

**Knowledge work is about converting information into something valuable**. But there are so many different ways of doing this, and so little structured guidance about how to do it, that most academics don't think of this as the conceptual core of what we do. And because of that, few have a systematic process for managing the many different kinds of information they come into contact with.

New knowledge emerges from a cycle of filtering, reading, writing, and sharing. And shortening the time it takes to complete a knowledge cycle means that you can generate more knowledge in less time, which is a fundamentally different approach to simply working harder. The methodical, goal-oriented gathering and processing of information is something that most of us are expected to do, but few of whom have received any structured advice in how to do it.

**Aim and objectives**

By the end of this course, you should have created a basic system for filtering, saving, extracting, processing, and sharing information that you've converted into something valuable for your professional community.

The objectives of this course are to:

1. Reduce the amount of information you pay attention to.
2. Save and organise information in a personal library.
3. Extract high-value information from a range of sources.
4. Convert information into something personally meaningful.
5. Increase your career capital by sharing what you learn.

_Note: While the tendency may be to focus on specific apps and tools, this course will focus on systems over software, or principles over products. There are too many different apps that could be useful for building a personal information management system, and are out of scope for this course. I'll point towards some of these apps during the lessons, typically as a way to get you started._
