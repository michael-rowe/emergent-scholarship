Much of academic work involves turning information into knowledge valuable to society, yet few academics receive guidance in managing the overwhelming influx of information or in effectively converting it into something valuable. In this course, you will develop a systematic approach to information management for academics, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively to increase your career capital. This process will help you reduce the amount of information vying for your attention, establish a personal library to curate high-value sources, and extract useful elements for conversion into shareable, valuable outputs.

Additionally, the course will introduce techniques for identifying and prioritizing key information sources, ensuring that you stay abreast of the latest developments in your field without getting lost in the sea of data. We will also explore methods for integrating this curated information into your research and teaching, enhancing your academic output's quality and impact. By the end of the course, you will have developed a robust personal system for information management that not only serves your immediate academic needs but also lays the foundation for sustained intellectual growth and productivity in your academic career.
