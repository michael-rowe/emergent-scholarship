I speak at conferences, universities, and professional organisations about artificial intelligence in health professions education and clinical practice. My talks aim to help audiences make sense of this moment, helping to understand what AI actually means for how we teach, learn, and practice.
## Get in touch

If you're interested in having me speak at your event, run a workshop, or facilitate a session, I'd be happy to discuss how I might contribute.

## Topics I speak about

### AI in health professions education

How should we teach when students have access to AI? What does AI mean for assessment, clinical reasoning development, and professional identity formation? What should students learn as AI increasingly develops sophisticated expertise within and across professional domains? These questions don't have settled answers yet, but educators can't wait for consensus before working on the issues. I explore practical approaches for curriculum design, administrative support, assessment redesign, and pedagogical decision-making that help educators navigate this transition with confidence rather than anxiety. Talks in this area are grounded in health professions education theory and draw on concrete examples from medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, and other allied health professions.

### AI for researchers

Using AI as a thinking partner for literature review, analysis, writing, and research design — not as a shortcut, but as a cognitive collaborator that amplifies scholarly judgement. This includes practical guidance on integrating AI into systematic review workflows, qualitative analysis, grant writing, and manuscript development, alongside honest discussion of the risks: hallucination, bias, and the erosion of deep reading habits. Aimed at researchers at any career stage who want to work more effectively without compromising intellectual rigour.

### AI in clinical practice

How do AI tools support clinical decision-making, documentation, and patient communication? How should practitioners evaluate and integrate these tools while maintaining professional responsibility and patient safety? How are patients starting to bring AI agents into their own health contexts, and how does this influence the therapist-patient relationship? I look at the evidence around AI-assisted diagnosis and decision support, how to critically appraise AI tools before adopting them, and what practitioners need to understand about the limitations of systems trained on data that may not reflect their patient population or clinical context.

### AI and practice management

Practical applications of AI in healthcare administration, workflow optimisation, and service delivery, with an honest assessment of what works, what doesn't, and what the implementation challenges look like on the ground. This includes scheduling, documentation, administrative support, patient communication, and service planning, with attention to the organisational change management that determines whether AI adoption actually improves practice or just adds complexity.

### Making sense of this moment

More theoretical and philosophical talks exploring what AI means for the health professions. How do we understand expertise, judgement, and human contribution when machines can generate fluent text and pass medical exams? What happens to the value of experience and tacit knowledge when AI can simulate competence? These talks help audiences develop frameworks for thinking about AI at wider scales rather than just reacting to it, grounding the conversation in the history and values of the professions rather than in technology hype.

### AI in nursing education: Benefits, opportunities and challenges
**Royal College of Nursing Education Conference** | Exeter | 15 April 2026

*Session in development*

### Keynote: Beyond the dataset — engaging people, powering change
**Physiotherapy Research Society Annual Conference** | Hatfield | 24 April 2026

*Keynote in development*

### Context sovereignty: Building human-AI coalitions in physiotherapy
**Association of Trauma and Orthopaedic Chartered Physiotherapists conference** | London | 24 September 2026

As AI systems become more capable at diagnosis, empathy, and clinical reasoning, practitioners who control their context more effectively will also control the meaning of their AI interactions. The therapeutic relationship will transform into negotiation between patient-AI and clinician-AI coalitions, requiring ongoing work to bring context to practice.

### AI masterclass for private practice clinicians
**Canadian Physiotherapy Association — Private Practice Education Committee** | Online | 24 October 2026

*Workshop in development* — A practical workshop for private practice clinicians across physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and allied health on using AI tools for clinical communication, professional content creation, and business tasks, alongside ethical and safe AI use.

### AI in nursing education (webinar series)
**Global Research Nursing Education Network** | Online | TBD

*Session in development* — An invited webinar or workshop for GRNEN's international network of nursing educators on AI literacy, AI in clinical nursing education, and navigating international regulatory considerations.

## Past talks (selected)

### Beyond document management: Graph infrastructure for professional education curricula
**Advance HE AI symposium** | Online | 10 February 2026

We propose a three-layer architecture using graph databases as the source of truth for curriculum structure, supported by vector databases for content retrieval and the Model Context Protocol for stakeholder interfaces. This approach makes curriculum structure explicitly queryable while preserving essential pedagogical mediation.
