I speak at conferences, universities, and professional organisations about artificial intelligence in health professions education and clinical practice. My talks aim to help audiences make sense of this moment, helping to understand what AI actually means for how we teach, learn, and practice.
## Get in touch

If you're interested in having me speak at your event, run a workshop, or facilitate a session, I'd be happy to discuss how I might contribute.

## Topics I speak about

### AI in health professions education

How should we teach when students have access to AI? What does AI mean for assessment, clinical reasoning development, and professional identity formation? What should students learn as AI increasingly develops sophisticated expertise within and across professional domains? I explore practical approaches for educators navigating this transition.

### AI for researchers

Using AI as a thinking partner for literature review, analysis, writing, and research design. Not AI as shortcut, but AI as cognitive collaborator that amplifies scholarly judgement.

### AI in clinical practice

What AI tools are emerging for clinical decision support, documentation, and patient communication? How should practitioners evaluate and integrate these tools while maintaining professional responsibility?

### AI and practice management

Practical applications of AI in healthcare administration, workflow optimisation, and service delivery—with honest assessment of what works and what doesn't.

### Making sense of this moment

More theoretical and philosophical talks exploring what AI means for the health professions. How do we understand expertise, judgement, and human contribution when machines can generate fluent text and pass medical exams? These talks help audiences develop frameworks for thinking about AI rather than just reacting to it.

### Beyond document management: Graph infrastructure for professional education curricula
**Advance HE AI symposium** | Online | 10 February 2026

We propose a three-layer architecture using graph databases as the source of truth for curriculum structure, supported by vector databases for content retrieval and the Model Context Protocol for stakeholder interfaces. This approach makes curriculum structure explicitly queryable while preserving essential pedagogical mediation.

### AI in nursing education: Benefits, opportunities and challenges
**Royal College of Nursing Education Conference** | Exeter | 15 April 2026

*Session in development*

### Context sovereignty: Building human-AI coalitions in physiotherapy
**Association of Trauma and Orthopaedic Chartered Physiotherapists conference** | London | 24 September 2026

As AI systems become more capable at diagnosis, empathy, and clinical reasoning, practitioners who control their context more effectively will also control the meaning of their AI interactions. The therapeutic relationship will transform into negotiation between patient-AI and clinician-AI coalitions, requiring ongoing work to bring context to practice.
