title: Emergent Scholarship
---
I'm Michael Rowe. I’m an academic and researcher working on technology-enhanced scholarship and artificial intelligence in health professions education. I’m also the [Director of Digital Innovation](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/8715fd15-a72b-46ba-8def-0ccc1e1670a4) in the School of Health and Care Sciences at the University of Lincoln.

This site is where I write and think about scholarship — how we learn, how we teach, how we create and share knowledge. I've spent my career exploring these questions, first in health professions education, now increasingly at the intersection of AI and academic practice.

**Emergent scholarship** is both the name of this site and an ongoing inquiry: what does it mean to do scholarly work when the tools, contexts, and expectations keep shifting? I don't have answers so much as working notes, arguments in progress, and the occasional conviction.

Right now I'm exploring how AI changes the nature of academic work — not just the tools we use, but what counts as expertise, how we assess learning, and what "scholarship" even means when generation becomes trivial.

I'm also developing an [[Courses/AI literacy/index|AI literacy course]] for academics, and writing about [[Essays/learning-alignment|the alignment problem in education]].

The graph view in the top right shows how ideas connect across the site. Each node is a page; lines show links between them. Click any node to navigate there, or use the global view to see the full network. It's a way to discover related ideas you might not find through linear browsing.

This site works a bit like an open source project: I work in public, ideas develop through iteration, and the process is part of the output. If something here is useful, use it. If you want to respond, [[contact|get in touch]].
