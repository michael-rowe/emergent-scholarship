## How this site is made

This site is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a static site generator created by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) for publishing digital gardens and interconnected notes.

Content is written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as markdown files, then transformed by Quartz into the website you see. The source files are version-controlled with Git and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Design

The site uses Quartz's default layout with custom modifications:

- **Typography** — Inter for headings and body text, IBM Plex Mono for code
- **Colours** — Custom palette with steel blue (`#3b6ea5`) for links in light mode, brighter blue (`#6b9fd4`) in dark mode
- **Components** — Custom navigation, share buttons, course layouts, and contextual sidebar

The design prioritises readability and connection-making. The graph view and backlinks surface relationships between ideas. The table of contents aids navigation in longer pieces.

## Philosophy

This site embodies several principles:

**Work in public** — Ideas develop through iteration. Notes, essays, and courses exist at different stages of development rather than only appearing when "finished."

**Connection over collection** — The value is in how ideas link together, not in accumulating isolated pages. The graph view and backlinks make this visible.

**Plain text, open formats** — Everything is markdown. No proprietary formats, no lock-in. The entire site can be rebuilt from plain text files.

**Own your platform** — Self-hosted on GitHub Pages rather than a platform that could disappear or change terms. The [source is public](https://github.com/michael-rowe/emergent-scholarship).

## AI-assisted development

This site was developed in collaboration with AI (primarily Claude Code). This includes:

- Technical implementation and custom components
- Content structure and navigation design
- Debugging and problem-solving
- Some initial drafting, then revised and verified

AI assists the work but doesn't replace judgement. Every piece of content reflects my thinking, verified against my principles and beliefs, and edited for voice.

## Accessibility

The site aims to be accessible:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigable
- Respects system dark mode preference
- Readable typography and sufficient contrast

If you encounter accessibility issues, please [[contact|let me know]].

## Essay versioning

Essays carry a version number that indicates their publication stage:

- **0.1–0.6** — Working draft; ideas under development, subject to significant change
- **0.7–0.8** — Preprint deposited; sufficiently complete to share, awaiting formal review
- **0.9** — Submitted to a peer-reviewed journal
- **1.0+** — Published in a peer-reviewed venue; minor revisions increment the decimal (e.g. 1.1)

Version numbers appear in the frontmatter of each essay and are visible in the "About this essay" section.
