A curated collection of resources I've read, listened to, or watched — and found worth recommending. Each entry includes my annotation: not just what the source says, but why it matters and what to expect from it.

Entries span books, articles, podcasts, videos, reports, and tools. Use the topic tags to find resources relevant to your interests.
