I'm committed to making this site accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of ability or technology.

## Standards

This site aims to conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) Level AA guidelines. While I can't guarantee perfect compliance, I actively work to identify and fix accessibility issues.

## What I've implemented

**Structure and navigation:**
- Semantic HTML (headings, landmarks, lists) for screen reader navigation
- Keyboard-accessible navigation throughout the site
- Skip links and logical focus order
- Consistent navigation across pages
- Breadcrumbs for orientation

**Visual design:**
- Sufficient colour contrast between text and backgrounds
- Text resizes without loss of functionality
- Dark mode support (respects system preference)
- Reader mode for distraction-free reading
- No content that flashes or strobes

**Content:**
- Descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Alt text for informational images
- Transcripts or descriptions for embedded media where possible
- Clear, plain language

**Technical:**
- Works without JavaScript for core content
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- No auto-playing media

## Known limitations

I'm aware of these issues and working to address them:

- **Graph view:** The interactive graph visualisation may be difficult to use with screen readers or keyboard alone. It's supplementary—all content is accessible through standard navigation.
- **Some embedded content:** Third-party embeds (videos, diagrams) may have their own accessibility limitations outside my control.
- **Older images:** Some images from earlier content may lack alt text. I'm progressively adding descriptions.
- **PDF documents:** Any linked PDFs may not be fully accessible. I aim to provide HTML alternatives where possible.
- **Mathematical notation:** LaTeX-rendered equations may not be fully accessible to screen readers.

## How I test

- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Browser accessibility inspection tools
- Automated testing with axe and Lighthouse
- Testing with system dark mode and text scaling
- Occasional screen reader testing (VoiceOver)

I don't currently have regular testing by users of assistive technologies. If you use assistive technology and encounter issues, your feedback is especially valuable.

## Feedback

If you encounter any accessibility barriers on this site, please [contact me](/contact). Include:

- The page URL where you encountered the issue
- A description of the problem
- The assistive technology you were using (if applicable)

I take accessibility issues seriously and will work to address them promptly.

## Continuous improvement

Accessibility is ongoing work, not a checkbox. I regularly review and improve the site's accessibility as I add new content and learn more about inclusive design.
