> Open access licensing transforms "All Rights Reserved" into "Some Rights Reserved." It is the legal engine that allows knowledge to flow freely across borders, enabling educators to build upon each other's work to solve global challenges in health and education.

## Open access licensing

**One-sentence definition:** Open access licensing is a standardized system of legal permissions that allow creators to grant the public the right to use, share, and sometimes adapt their work under specific conditions.

Traditional copyright is often a barrier to the rapid dissemination of knowledge, especially in clinical and educational contexts. Open access licenses (most notably Creative Commons) provide a simple way for authors to tell the world exactly how their work can be used without the need for individual legal negotiations. This creates a "legal commons" of resources that anyone can use to improve their teaching or research.

### Why it matters for educators
- **Open Educational Resources (OER):** It allows for the creation of high-quality, free textbooks and teaching materials. An educator can take an "Open Access" anatomy atlas, adapt it for their local curriculum, and legally share it with their students and colleagues.
- **Global Knowledge Equity:** In the health professions, paywalls often prevent practitioners in resource-limited settings from accessing the latest evidence. Open access removes these barriers, ensuring that life-saving information is available to everyone, regardless of their institutional affiliation or wealth.
- **Academic Visibility:** Research that is published under an open access license is more likely to be read, cited, and translated, increasing the reach and impact of the author's scholarship. It aligns with the principle of [[Essays/publishing-with-purpose|publishing with purpose]]—prioritizing the dissemination of ideas over the prestige of a specific journal.

### Creative Commons (CC) Framework
The CC system uses four main building blocks to define permissions:
- **BY (Attribution):** You must credit the original author (fundamental for academic integrity).
- **SA (ShareAlike):** You must use the same license for any work you build on top of this one.
- **NC (Non-Commercial):** You cannot use the work for commercial purposes.
- **ND (NoDerivatives):** You can share the work, but you cannot change it.
