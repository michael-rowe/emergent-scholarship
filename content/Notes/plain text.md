> Plain text is the only file format guaranteed to be readable decades from now. By stripping away the layers of proprietary software and complex binary code, it provides a stable, "future-proof" foundation for individual scholarship and institutional memory.

## Plain text

**One-sentence definition:** Plain text is data consisting only of readable characters (encoded in standards like UTF-8), containing no hidden formatting code or dependency on specific software.

In an era of proprietary silos and "software-as-a-service" subscriptions, plain text offers a radical simplicity. It is the "lowest common denominator" of computer data, readable by every operating system and programming language ever written. For the educator, choosing plain text is a choice for **data sovereignty**: it ensures that your intellectual property is not "trapped" within the business model of a software company.

### Strategic significance
- **Longevity and Sustainability:** Academic and clinical knowledge often needs to be preserved over decades. While proprietary formats from the 1990s are now difficult to open, a plain text file from that era remains perfectly accessible. It is the most sustainable format for long-term archiving.
- **Interoperability:** Plain text is the medium through which different systems communicate. It allows for [[Notes/contextual interoperability|contextual interoperability]], where information can flow seamlessly between a personal notes app, a university's curriculum management system, and an AI assistant.
- **AI and Searchability:** Large language models and system-level search tools (like grep) are designed to "ingest" plain text. Keeping your curriculum or research data in plain text makes it instantly queryable, allowing you to find connections across thousands of documents without needing to open them one by one.

### Beyond the text file
While "plain text" sounds simple, it is the building block for more sophisticated tools like [[Notes/markdown|Markdown]], [[Notes/latex|LaTeX]], and even computer code. It represents a move away from "document management" toward **information architecture**. When your content is plain text, it becomes data that can be manipulated, analyzed, and transformed programmatically, which is the first step toward building more intelligent educational systems.
