There are fundamental differences between [[prompt engineering]] and [[context engineering]] as approaches to enhancing AI responses. Prompt engineering relies on retrieving text based on statistical similarity, while context engineering leverages structured, relationship-aware knowledge representations. The distinction is crucial because it shapes the capabilities, complexity, and use cases of AI systems, marking an evolutionary step from simple retrieval to sophisticated reasoning.

**Prompt engineering** focuses on:

- **Linear flow**: Query → Search → Retrieve → Generate
- **Flat information**: Text chunks based on similarity
- **Single-hop reasoning**: Direct question-answer patterns

**Context engineering** enables:

- **Graph-aware flow**: Query → Reason → Traverse → Synthesise
- **Structured knowledge**: Entities, relationships, hierarchies
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Complex inference across connected concepts

> These represent an evolutionary progression in how AI systems access, process, and reason over information, moving from statistical similarity-based retrieval to structured relationship-aware reasoning. - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> They represent fundamentally different approaches to knowledge representation and retrieval that have significant implications for system capabilities, implementation complexity, and use cases. - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> Core Philosophy: "Find information that appears contextually similar to the query" (Prompt Engineering)
> Core Philosophy: "Understand and reason over the explicit relationships between concepts" (Context Engineering) - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

### Decision framework

Choose [[prompt engineering]] when:

- Simple question-answering requirements
- Limited implementation resources
- Mature, stable knowledge domains
- Fast deployment needed

Choose [[context engineering]] when:

- Complex reasoning requirements
- Multi-source knowledge integration needed
- Domain expertise requires relationship understanding
- Long-term knowledge management strategy
