There are people talking about how [[prompt engineering]] is going to be an occupation of the future, based on the fact that it requires some expertise to do well now (i.e. early 2023).

But at some point, we'll have [[auto-prompting]], in which case, anything a human comes up with is probably just adding noise.

Matt Turck [says that](https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1645842364450078738), "Being “good at prompt engineering” in 2023 is like being “good at Googling” in 2003", which seems like a reasonable position.

Acar (2023) says that [[problem formulation]] will be a more important skill for working with generative AI, than [[prompt engineering]].
