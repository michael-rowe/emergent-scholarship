*Prompt engineering* is using natural language to produce a desired response from a large language model (LLM).

It is the process of iteratively refining an AI-generated output, as produced by models like [[Generative Pretrained Transformer|GPT]] or [[DALL-E]].

Prompt engineering relies on retrieving text based on statistical similarity (i.e. [[embeddings are learned semantic vectors]])

Prompt engineering focuses on crafting the optimal textual input by selecting the appropriate words, phrases, sentence structures, and punctuation (Acar, 2023). It requires a firm grasp of a specific AI tool and linguistic proficiency.

> ...there are a lot of people out there that are wildly creative, but cannot put pen to paper or mouse to pixel or however you want to create it. But their brains work in that creative way. So now they're prompt engineers... . And it's not just prompt engineers in that, if I say, give me a horse with a red hat, that's not art. But it's almost like you'll track the amount of prompt interaction. Like you'll say this was a piece of art that was created with 1500 different prompts that went into it. I think the refinement piece is going to be really interesting. - Kevin Rose (2022)

Despite early emphases on prompt engineering, it seems reasonable to assume that [[prompt engineering is not going to be an occupation]], and that the ability to [[problem formulation|formulate the problem]] for which generative AI is the solution, will be a more appropriate skill to develop.
