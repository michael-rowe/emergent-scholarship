> [!info] Transparency as a public good
> Open source is the "community of practice" applied to software engineering. By making the "recipe" for tools public, it ensures that technology is subject to peer review, collective improvement, and democratic control, rather than being a "black box" owned by a single corporation.

## Open source software

**One-sentence definition:** Open source software (OSS) is software whose source code is made available under a license that grants users the right to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

The power of open source lies in its transparency and its community. In proprietary software, the inner workings are a secret (closed source), and users must trust the vendor for security and updates. In open source, the code is a "public health" asset; anyone can inspect it for vulnerabilities, suggest improvements, or "fork" the project to create a version that better serves their specific needs. This model has produced much of the world's most critical digital infrastructure, from the Linux operating system to the Python programming language.

### Why it matters for educators
- **Institutional Resilience:** If a commercial software vendor goes out of business or changes its pricing, the institution is often "locked in." With open source, the community can maintain the software indefinitely, providing a more stable and sustainable foundation for educational systems.
- **Collaborative Innovation:** Educators can participate in the development of the tools they use. If a learning management system or a portfolio tool is open source, a university can add features that its specific student body needs and share those improvements back with the global community.
- **Digital and [[Notes/context sovereignty|Context Sovereignty]]:** Using open source tools ensures that an institution maintains control over its data and its technological destiny. It prevents the "colonization" of educational practice by proprietary platforms that dictate how teaching and learning should occur through their design choices.

### The Community Pillar
What distinguishes successful open source projects is not just the code, but the health of the community around it. This includes shared governance, transparent decision-making, and a culture of mutual support. For the health professions, this mirrors the way we maintain clinical guidelines and professional standards—through collective expertise and open critique for the common good.
