> [!info] The pattern beneath the practice
> Every few years, a "new literacy" emerges—information literacy, media literacy, digital literacy, data literacy, AI literacy. Each claims to address novel challenges. But examine their frameworks closely and you'll find the same six dimensions appearing again and again. What changes isn't the structure of literacy itself but the specific context where it's applied.

## Common architecture of literacy

**One-sentence definition:** A structural pattern of six dimensions shared across different literacy domains—what changes between information, media, digital, data, and [[AI literacy]] is the content, not the underlying architecture of what it means to be literate.

When information literacy emerged in the 1980s, it seemed tailored to library research. When media literacy developed in the 1990s, it appeared specific to understanding constructed messages. When digital literacy arose in the 2000s, it looked unique to technology. But map these frameworks and the pattern becomes clear: they're variations on the same six-dimensional structure.

This isn't coincidence. It reveals something fundamental about literacy itself—not as domain-specific skill but as a consistent set of capabilities that applies across different contexts.

## The six dimensions

These dimensions appear across every literacy framework, though emphasised differently by domain:

**Access and recognition:** Identifying when something is present and relevant, knowing how to locate or engage with it. Information literacy emphasises library databases. Media literacy emphasises constructed messages. Digital literacy emphasises technology platforms. [[AI literacy]] emphasises AI systems. Same dimension, different context.

**Critical evaluation:** Assessing quality, reliability, limitations, and bias. Every literacy tradition centres this—questioning sources (information), understanding construction techniques (media), recognising algorithmic influence (digital), spotting hallucinations (AI). The specific criteria change. The imperative to evaluate remains constant.

**Functional application:** Practical ability to use effectively for specific purposes. This is operational competence—the "how to" dimension. Often conflated with literacy itself, but it's only one piece.

**Creation and communication:** Generating new outputs and sharing effectively. Moving beyond consumption to production. Every literacy includes this—writing research papers (information), creating media messages (media), building digital artifacts (digital), collaborating with AI (AI).

**Ethical awareness and responsibility:** Understanding social, ethical, and civic implications. Recognising issues of privacy, equity, power, and impact. This dimension has grown more prominent in recent frameworks but appears even in early information literacy work.

**Contextual judgement and metacognition:** Developing taste, professional judgement, and self-awareness about practice. Knowing when and how to apply capabilities appropriately. This dimension often receives least attention but may matter most—particularly for [[AI literacy]], where capabilities evolve rapidly and context determines value.

## Why this pattern matters

Recognising the common architecture does three things:

**First**, it reveals that developing "AI literacy" isn't starting from scratch. We already know how to teach literacy—the frameworks exist, tested across decades and domains. Apply the six dimensions to AI context and you have a coherent approach.

**Second**, it suggests that literacy is genuinely transferable. Someone who developed information literacy has partial foundation for media literacy, digital literacy, AI literacy. The dimensions transfer; only the specific content changes.

**Third**, it identifies where literacy development actually happens: not in acquiring knowledge (though that helps) but in integrating the six dimensions into contextually appropriate practice. You cannot be literate in dimension three (functional application) without dimension two (critical evaluation) or dimension six (contextual judgement). They work together.

## The sixth dimension problem

While all six dimensions matter, the sixth—contextual judgement and metacognition—deserves particular attention for [[AI literacy]]. As AI capabilities expand, the ability to know *when* and *whether* to use AI becomes more valuable than knowing *how* to use it.

This connects to ideas about [[taste-and-judgement|taste and judgement]] in human-AI systems. Technical competence without judgement is reckless. Ethical awareness without the ability to apply it contextually is impotent. The sixth dimension integrates the others into coherent, adaptive practice.

This dimension is also hardest to teach because it develops through sustained practice and reflection rather than instruction. Which is precisely why recognising it as essential matters—it shifts focus from delivering content to creating conditions for practice.

## Notes

The six-dimension framework isn't the only way to conceptualise literacy, but it effectively captures what multiple independent literacy traditions have converged on. Different frameworks use different terminology and emphasise different dimensions, but the underlying structure recurs consistently.
