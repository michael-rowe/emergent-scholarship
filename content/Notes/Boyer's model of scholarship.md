## Definition

**Scholarship** (as proposed by Boyer, 1990) has 4 separate but overlapping meanings:

1. The [[scholarship of discovery]] (research): original research or the search for new knowledge.
2. The [[scholarship of integration]]: putting isolated facts into context.
3. The [[scholarship of application]] or engagement (service): goes beyond the service duties of a faculty member to those within or outside the University and involves the rigour and application of disciplinary expertise with results that can be shared with and/or evaluated by peers.
4. The [[scholarship of teaching and learning]]: involves the systematic study of teaching and learning processes.

Boyer's expanded conception of *scholarship* is an attempt to move beyond the [[teaching-research nexus|teaching vs research debate]] in higher education and positions scholarly practice as a continuum between the two.

## Context and Background

Boyer was looking to move *scholarship* away from the binary of 'teaching' or 'research' but it was still in the context of academia. This definition firmly positions scholarship within the academy i.e. as part of the role of academics, researchers, and practitioners.

## Related Concepts

*Scholarship of Discovery*: Focuses on original research.
*Scholarship of Integration*: Focuses on synthesis across disciplines.
*Scholarship of Application*: Focuses on applying expertise to significant problems.
*Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)*: Focuses on the study of teaching/learning.

## Distinctive Characteristics

> The scholarly method or scholarship is the body of principles and practices used by scholars to make their claims about the subject as valid and trustworthy as possible and to make them known to the scholarly public… Scholarship…is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and is peer-reviewed. - Wikipedia (2020)

This definition of scholarship does not address the question of [[quality of scholarly work]].

## Implications

> We need a reward system that reflects the diversity of our institutions and the breadth of scholarship, as well. The challenge is to strike a balance among teaching, research, and service...We need better ways, besides publication, to evaluate scholarly performance... - [[Ernest Boyer]] (1990)

## My Thinking

These definitions firmly position scholarship within the academy i.e. as part of the role of academics, researchers, and practitioners. Boyer was looking to move *scholarship* away from the binary of 'teaching' or 'research' but it was still in the context of academia.
