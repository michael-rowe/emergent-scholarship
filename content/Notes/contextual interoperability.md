> Contextual interoperability is what allows AI to move from "searching text" to "understanding intent." It solves the problem of making your personal thinking machine-readable without losing the specific meaning you've assigned to it.

## Contextual interoperability

**One-sentence definition:** The capacity to make human knowledge and reasoning machine-readable while preserving its human meaning, creating a functional interface between human and artificial intelligence.

In traditional systems, AI treats your notes as disconnected chunks of text. Contextual interoperability enables the AI to comprehend the *architecture* of your thinking—the specific relationships between concepts, the frameworks you've developed, and the questions that drive your work. It transforms a personal knowledge base from a storage system into a cognitive interface.

### What it enables
- **Relational reasoning:** Instead of simple keyword retrieval, AI can follow chains of connection (e.g., "Theory A *critiques* Theory B") to provide more nuanced support.
- **Proactive assistance:** By understanding your cognitive landscape, AI can identify relevant information or connections even when you don't know to ask for them.
- **[[Notes/context sovereignty|Context sovereignty]]:** Structured context can be shared temporarily with AI models, allowing them to reason within your framework without requiring you to hand over your entire intellectual history.

### Strategic significance
Contextual interoperability is the bridge between personal knowledge management and effective AI collaboration. It requires making the implicit relationships in our work explicit through tools like [[Notes/knowledge graph|knowledge graphs]] and [[model context protocol|MCP]]. By designing our documentation as "machine-readable meaning," we create the infrastructure necessary for AI to act as a genuine partner in scholarship rather than just a sophisticated search tool.
