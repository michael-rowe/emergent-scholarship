> [!info] Logical structure over visual layout
> LaTeX is the gold standard for precision in academic publishing. By requiring the author to define the logical structure of a document rather than its visual appearance, it ensures that formatting remains perfectly consistent, references stay accurate, and the final output is of professional typeset quality.

## LaTeX

**One-sentence definition:** LaTeX (pronounced 'Lay-tek') is a document preparation system where authors use markup commands to describe the structure of their work, which is then compiled into a high-quality PDF.

In a word processor, you are responsible for the "look" of every paragraph, heading, and image as you type. In LaTeX, you are a "director" who gives instructions: `\section{Anatomy}`, `\begin{table}`, `\cite{Jones2024}`. The system then applies centuries-old rules of professional typography to handle the layout, spacing, and font choice. This separation of content from style is what makes LaTeX the industry standard for mathematical, scientific, and technical publishing.

### Why it matters for educators
- **Handling Complexity:** For long documents—like a PhD thesis, a 200-page curriculum map, or a complex research paper—standard word processors often become unstable. LaTeX is designed to handle thousands of pages, hundreds of images, and thousands of cross-references with absolute stability.
- **Perfect Referencing:** LaTeX automatically manages your table of contents, your list of figures, and your entire bibliography. If you move a chapter from the end of a book to the beginning, every citation, figure number, and internal reference in the entire document updates instantly and accurately.
- **Mathematical and Scientific Precision:** No other system handles complex formulas, chemical structures, or statistical tables with the same aesthetic and structural rigour. If your teaching involves precision data, LaTeX is the tool that ensures it is presented clearly and professionally.

### The "Single Source" Mindset
Like [[Notes/markdown|Markdown]], LaTeX uses [[Notes/plain text|plain text]] source files. This means your work is not "trapped" in a binary file format that might become obsolete. It allows for a workflow where you can focus entirely on the intellectual structure of your curriculum or research, knowing that the final "production" of the document will be handled flawlessly by the system.
