Context engineering is underpinned by principles such as sharing context, recognising that actions carry implicit decisions, and building systems that are flexible and modular. Successful context engineering relies on a structured approach: knowledge architecture (organising information), integration systems (bridging information and AI tools), and implementation strategy (deploying and measuring solutions). These principles are still evolving as the field matures.

> At the core of reliability is Context Engineering. - [[Walden Yan]]

> Making context engineering work comes down to three key elements: Knowledge Architecture, Integration Systems, Implementation Strategy. - [[Sean King]]

> Context engineering is a system... This system is dynamic... You need the right information... You need the right tools... The format matters... Can it plausibly accomplish the task? - [[Harrison Chase]]

**Potential connections:**
- Connects with broader themes of software engineering, modularity, and system design.
- Can be linked to notes on the evolution of best practices in AI and the need for ongoing adaptation.
- Relevant for discussions on the future of AI agent development and the standardisation of context engineering principles.
