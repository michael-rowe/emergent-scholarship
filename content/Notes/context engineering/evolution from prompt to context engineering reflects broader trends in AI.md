The shift from [[prompt engineering]] to [[context engineering]] should be explored within the context of larger trends in AI, such as the move from manual to automated intelligence, simple retrieval to complex, [[multi-hop reasoning]], and individual to systematic approaches. It also notes the recognition of [[context engineering is a distinct system-level discipline]] and the growing importance of [[information architecture]] as way of expressing relationships between entities as part of [[knowledge representation]].

> The progression follows a clear pattern: Manual craft → Automated intelligence; Simple retrieval → Complex reasoning; Individual optimization → Systematic architecture - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> Context Engineering becoming a formal discipline... Knowledge Architecture gaining importance alongside information retrieval... Relationship-aware AI replacing similarity-based systems - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> For many applications, a hybrid approach leveraging both paradigms may provide optimal results. - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]
