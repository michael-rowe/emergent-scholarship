- Prompt engineering is simpler and faster to implement but limited in reasoning and relationship modelling.
- Context engineering enables sophisticated reasoning and access control but requires more complex infrastructure and expertise.

Understanding these trade-offs is key for making informed choices about AI system design.

> Prompt Engineering: Simpler implementation and maintenance... Effective for straightforward information retrieval... No logical reasoning capabilities... Cannot handle complex multi-hop queries - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> Context Engineering: Sophisticated reasoning capabilities... Multi-hop inference support... Permission-based access control... Higher implementation complexity... Longer development cycles - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> The choice between paradigms should be based on specific use case requirements, implementation capabilities, and long-term strategic goals. - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

**Potential connections:**
- Relates to themes of project management, technical debt, and system scalability.
- Connects with notes on decision frameworks, resource allocation, and AI adoption strategies.
- Useful for guiding technology selection and roadmap planning.
