[[Prompt engineering]] and [[context engineering]] paradigms differ in their technical stacks, from data storage to query processing. Prompt engineering uses [[vector database]]s and [[embeddings are learned semantic vectors|embeddings]], focusing on implicit relationships, while context engineering employs [[knowledge graph]]s with explicit, typed relationships and supports [[multi-hop reasoning]]. Understanding these differences is essential for selecting the right architecture for a given AI application.

> Prompt Engineering: Text chunks converted to numerical vectors (embeddings)... Relationships: Implicit through statistical co-occurrence patterns... Semantic Encoding: Distributional semantics ("you know a word by the company it keeps") - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> Context Engineering: Entities connected by explicit, typed relationships... Relationships: Explicit and navigable... Semantic Encoding: Structural semantics ("you know a concept by its connections") - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]

> Context Engineering Stack: Knowledge graphs with relationship traversal... Complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning... Enhanced language models with graph reasoning capabilities - [[engineering_paradigms_handover.md]]
