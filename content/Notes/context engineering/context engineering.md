*Context engineering* is the process of building context in a way that makes it easier for AI - and humans - to understand how concepts link together.

It can be manual, as in how I build relationships between notes in Obsidian, or automated, as in how [[graphRAG]] automates the creation of [[knowledge graph]]s.

Context engineering leverages structured, relationship-aware knowledge representations, of the kind you get through [[knowledge graph]]s that are built with [[graphRAG]] techniques.

In this way, knowledge architectures become as important as information retrieval (the primary emphasis of [[prompt engineering]] techniques).

Traditional chatbots force a choice: either work with the model's general knowledge or upload everything and hope it fits in context. Context engineering sidesteps this entirely. Instead of cramming your organisation's entire knowledge base into a model, you build intelligent retrieval systems that surface exactly the relevant information when needed. GraphRAG can pull related concepts from across your documentation, whilst knowledge graphs can traverse relationships to find non-obvious connections. The model receives precisely what it needs, when it needs it.

Some people misunderstand what this means, thinking it is simply a case of adding more context e.g. giving models access to your emails and calendar. This feels like [[prompt injection]] with more sources (i.e. just another form of [[prompt engineering]]).

**Bring Context to AI**
- AI needs context to be useful, especially the context you bring.
- Figuring out what you want and inputting that into the algorithm is an important task.
- Context exists within organisations or even when working alone to create something of value.
- AI by default pays attention to nothing, highlighting the importance of human input.
