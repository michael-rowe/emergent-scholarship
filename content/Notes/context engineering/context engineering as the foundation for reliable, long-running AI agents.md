Reliability in AI agents, especially those designed for long-running or complex tasks, depends on effective context engineering. Without the right context, even the most advanced models will fail to perform consistently. Context engineering is thus seen as the primary responsibility of engineers building AI agents, requiring ongoing refinement and adaptation as the field advances.

> In 2025, the models out there are extremely intelligent. But even the smartest human won’t be able to do their job effectively without the context of what they’re being asked to do. - [[Walden Yan]]

> Most of the time when an agent is not performing reliably the underlying cause is that the appropriate context, instructions and tools have not been communicated to the model. - [[Harrison Chase]]

> At the core of reliability is Context Engineering. - [[Walden Yan]]

**Potential connections:**
- Relates to themes of agent reliability, error management, and the challenges of scaling AI systems.
- Can be linked to notes on the limitations of multi-agent architectures and the importance of context sharing.
- Relevant for discussions on the future of AI agent frameworks and best practices for production deployment.
