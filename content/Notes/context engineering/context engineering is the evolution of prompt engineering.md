Context engineering represents a shift from crafting clever prompts to designing dynamic systems that provide [[large language model]]s (LLMs) with all the necessary information, instructions, and tools to accomplish tasks reliably. Unlike [[prompt engineering]], which focuses on the wording of individual queries, context engineering is about building pipelines and frameworks that gather, format, and supply relevant context at runtime. This evolution is driven by the need for LLM-powered applications to perform consistently and scale beyond simple, [[stateless nature of language models]].

> The core skill is "providing all the necessary context for the LLM" rather than just crafting clever prompts. - [[Daniel Chalef]]

> Context engineering is building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task. - [[Harrison Chase]]

> “Prompt engineering” was coined as a term for the effort needing to write your task in the ideal format for a LLM chatbot. “Context engineering” is the next level of this. - [[Walden Yan]]

**Potential connections:**
- Relates to the broader theme of systems thinking in AI development.
- Connects with notes on the limitations of prompt engineering and the need for robust, scalable AI solutions.
- Can be linked to discussions on the evolution of software engineering practices for AI.
