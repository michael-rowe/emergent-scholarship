Effective context engineering requires dynamic retrieval of information from external sources and robust memory management to maintain relevant information across interactions. This includes summarising previous conversations, tracking user preferences, and integrating real-time data. The goal is to ensure that LLMs have access to the right context, tools, and instructions, formatted appropriately, to maximise their performance and reliability.

> Rather than relying solely on the model's training data, context engineering involves fetching relevant information from external sources (knowledge bases, databases, APIs, or real-time data feeds) and incorporating it into the model's context window. - [[Daniel Chalef]]

> For applications that involve ongoing interactions, context engineering includes strategies for maintaining relevant information across conversations while managing the constraints of finite context windows. - [[Daniel Chalef]]

> Complex agents likely get context from many sources. Context can come from the developer of the application, the user, previous interactions, tool calls, or other external data. Pulling these all together involves a complex system. - [[Harrison Chase]]

**Potential connections:**
- Links to notes on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and adaptive prompting.
- Connects with broader themes of knowledge management and information architecture in AI.
- Relevant to discussions on the challenges of building long-running, reliable AI agents.
