Context engineering is not merely an evolution of prompt engineering but a fundamentally different, system-level discipline. It focuses on designing dynamic, state-aware information ecosystems for AI agents, shifting the frontier of AI development from model-centric optimisation to context-centric architecture. The most capable models often underperform not due to their own limitations, but because they are provided with incomplete or poorly structured context. This shift requires practitioners to architect the entire world of knowledge, tools, and signals that an AI needs to interpret and act effectively.

> Context Engineering is not an extension of prompt engineering but a distinct system-level discipline focused on creating dynamic, state-aware information ecosystems for AI agents. - [[Sundeep Teki]]

> The most capable models underperform not due to inherent flaws, but because they are provided with an incomplete, "half-baked view of the world". - [[Sundeep Teki]]

> The central argument is that "context is king" and serves as the primary differentiator between a fragile demo and a robust, production-grade AI product. - [[Sundeep Teki]]

**Potential connections:**
- Deepens the distinction between prompt engineering and context engineering in your existing notes.
- Connects to themes of reliability, information architecture, and the evolution of AI development practices.
