This site respects your privacy. Here's exactly what data is collected and how it's used.

## Analytics

This site uses [Umami](https://umami.is/), a privacy-focused analytics tool. Umami:

- Does not use cookies
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not track you across websites
- Only records anonymous, aggregated data (page views, referrers, device types)
- Is hosted in the EU and complies with GDPR

You cannot be identified from the analytics data collected.

## Comments

Comments are powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which uses GitHub Discussions. When you comment:

- You authenticate through your GitHub account
- Your comment is stored in the [site's GitHub repository](https://github.com/michael-rowe/home-michael)
- Your GitHub username and profile picture are displayed with your comment
- Giscus does not track you beyond the comment functionality

If you don't have a GitHub account or prefer not to use it, you can [[contact|contact me directly]] instead.

## Newsletter

The newsletter is managed through [Kit](https://kit.com/) (formerly ConvertKit). When you subscribe:

- Your email address is stored by Kit
- You'll receive emails when I publish the newsletter (typically monthly)
- You can unsubscribe at any time via the link in any email
- Your email is never shared with third parties
- Kit's privacy policy applies: [kit.com/privacy](https://kit.com/privacy)

## Contact form

The contact form uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/). When you submit a message:

- Your name, email, phone (if provided), and message are sent to me via email
- Web3Forms does not store your submission long-term
- I receive your message directly and may respond via email
- Your information is not shared with third parties

## Cookies

This site does not use cookies for tracking. The only cookies that may be set are:

- **Theme preference** - Remembers your light/dark mode choice (stored locally in your browser)

## Third-party embeds

Some pages may include embedded content (videos, diagrams, forms). These embeds may set their own cookies according to their respective privacy policies.
