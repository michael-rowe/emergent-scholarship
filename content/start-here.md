title: Start here

Welcome. This site is built on a simple premise: **you can get better at getting better**.

Emergent scholarship is a framework for the entire knowledge creation process — from noticing problems worth solving, to learning what you need to learn, to sharing what you've discovered in ways that create value.

Whether you're an academic navigating institutional pressures, a researcher trying to stay current, or an independent thinker committed to rigorous work — there's something here for you.

## Choose your entry point

### Got 10 minutes?

Read [[Posts/2025-10-10-a-better-game|A better game]]. It's a short piece that captures the philosophy behind this site — and might change how you think about working with AI.

### Got an hour?

Start with [[Courses/Time management/index|Time management for academics]]. It's the most immediately practical course, and you'll walk away with systems you can use tomorrow.

### Want the full picture?

Read the [[Book/01 introduction|introduction to the book]]. It explains what emergent scholarship is, why it matters, and how the pieces fit together.
