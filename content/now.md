## What I'm working on

Right now I'm exploring how AI changes the nature of academic work — not just the tools we use, but what counts as expertise, how we assess learning, and what "scholarship" even means when content generation is trivial.

Specifically:

- **[[Courses/AI literacy/index|AI literacy for academics]]** — a course developing comprehensive AI literacy across six interconnected dimensions, using a developmental framework that moves from basic competence through adaptation to transformation.
- **[[Essays/documentation-as-infrastructure|Documentation as infrastructure]]** — writing about how documentation becomes infrastructure when AI agents are the primary readers, and what that means for institutions.
- **[[Essays/curriculum-infrastructure|Curriculum infrastructure]]** — exploring graph database architecture for professional education curricula, co-authored with Wesley Lynch.
