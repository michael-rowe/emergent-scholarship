A living document of the tools and systems I use for academic work, writing, and maintaining this site. Inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

## Writing and thinking

**[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — Where all my thinking happens. Notes, drafts, course materials, research — everything lives here as interconnected markdown files. The linking and graph view help me see connections I'd otherwise miss.

**[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — My primary AI collaborator for research, writing, and development. I use it as a thinking partner rather than a content generator — for testing arguments, exploring ideas, building this site, and working through problems. This site was largely built in conversation with Claude Code.

**[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** and **[Qwen CLI](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen)** — Alternative AI tools I use alongside Claude for different perspectives and capabilities.

**[Zed](https://zed.dev/)** — A fast, modern code editor I sometimes use for quick edits and exploring code.

**Markdown** — All content is written in plain markdown. No lock-in, version-controllable, portable forever.

## Research and reading

**[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)** — My primary browser. Highly customisable with good tab management and built-in features. I keep [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as alternatives, and occasionally experiment with [Brave](https://brave.com/).

**[Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/)** — Search engine that plants trees. Good enough for most searches, and I like supporting the model.

**[Reader by Readwise](https://readwise.io/read)** — Where I read almost everything. Articles, newsletters, PDFs, EPUBs. All highlights and annotations automatically export to Obsidian, keeping everything connected.

**[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)** — Reference management. Free, open source, and works well with Obsidian via plugins.

**[Gemini Deep Research](https://gemini.google.com/)** and **[ChatGPT Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/)** — For research discovery and initial literature exploration before diving into primary sources.

## This site

**[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)** — A static site generator designed for publishing digital gardens. Transforms my Obsidian vault into this website with graph view, backlinks, and full-text search.

**[GitHub](https://github.com/michael-rowe/emergent-scholarship)** — Version control and hosting via GitHub Pages. The entire site is open source.

**[Giscus](https://giscus.app/)** — Comments powered by GitHub Discussions. No separate account needed if you have GitHub.

**[Umami](https://umami.is/)** — Privacy-focused analytics. No cookies, no personal data, just anonymous page view counts.

**[Kit](https://kit.com/)** — Newsletter management (formerly ConvertKit).

## Hardware

**ASUS ZenBook 13"** — Primary machine running [AerynOS](https://aerynos.com/) with the GNOME desktop. Linux for the flexibility and control.

**Google Pixel 6** — Phone for quick capture, reading, and staying connected.

## Principles

A few principles guide my tool choices:

- **Plain text where possible** — Markdown, not proprietary formats
- **Own your data** — Self-hosted or exportable, never locked in
- **Fewer tools, deeper use** — Master a few rather than dabble in many
- **AI as partner, not replacement** — Augment thinking, don't outsource it
- **Community-built software** — Prefer tools built by people working together in the open
