A practical introduction to prompt engineering for academics and researchers — not just tips and tricks, but a framework for thinking about how to communicate effectively with AI systems.

## What this guide will cover

- Why "prompt engineering" is a misleading name
- The anatomy of an effective prompt
- Context, constraints, and examples
- Iterative refinement: treating AI interaction as conversation
- Domain-specific patterns for research tasks
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## In the meantime

- Read [[Posts/2025-10-10-a-better-game|A better game]] for the philosophical foundation
- Explore the [[Courses/AI literacy/index|AI literacy course]] *(in development)*
- See [[Notes/prompt engineering|the note on prompt engineering]] for a brief overview
