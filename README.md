# Emergent Scholarship

> A framework for getting better at getting better

This is not a portfolio or collection of outputs. It's a **project** demonstrating a framework for the entire knowledge creation pipeline - from identifying problems worth solving, to learning systematically, to sharing what you've learned in ways that matter.

Think of it like an open source software project:
- **A working framework** you can learn from and adapt
- **A demonstration** of that framework in practice
- **A place where outputs accumulate** through the process
- **An invitation to participate** in a different way of working

## What is emergent scholarship?

Emergent scholarship is a framework for knowledge work - not just publishing differently, but working differently as someone who creates and shares knowledge.

Most approaches focus on outputs: papers published, credentials earned, metrics achieved. But the real leverage is in the process - how you identify what's worth learning, how you actually learn it, how you connect it to what you already know, how you share it usefully.

Traditional scholarly values - rigour, evidence, transparency - remain essential. Emergent scholarship asks how those values can be realised across the whole pipeline, in ways that are more connected, open, sustainable, and responsive to real-world challenges.

### Core principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Knowledge through connection** | Understanding emerges from relationships and interactions rather than residing in isolated minds or texts |
| **Information flow through networks** | Information moves through formal and informal networks, creating new patterns and insights |
| **Identity through community** | Professional identity forms through participation in multiple overlapping communities of practice |
| **Innovation through openness** | Innovation emerges from environments where ideas flow freely and evolve through collaboration |
| **Meaning through medium** | The forms and formats we use to express knowledge shape understanding and learning |
| **Value through engagement** | Worth is determined through meaningful impact and stakeholder engagement |
| **Sustainability through ecology** | Learning environments must respect and enhance human and environmental resources |

## How does it work?

This project embodies its principles through its workflow:

```
Obsidian (Markdown) → Git/GitHub → Quartz → GitHub Pages
                                      ↓
                             OSF (DOI + Preprint)
```

1. **Markdown** for writing - plain text focusing on content over presentation
2. **Git/GitHub** for versioning - transparent history and public engagement
3. **Quartz** for presentation - automated conversion to a responsive static site
4. **GitHub Actions** for deployment - automated building and publishing
5. **OSF** for academic citations - DOIs and permanent snapshots via preprints

### Essay versioning

Essays follow a semantic versioning system reflecting their maturity:

| Version | Stage |
|---------|-------|
| **0.5** | First shareable draft - coherent expression of the idea |
| **0.7** | Polished version - 1-2 rounds of edits |
| **0.9** | Final draft - published as preprint with DOI |
| **1.0** | Version of record - peer-reviewed publication |
| **1.1+** | Minor updates and clarifications |
| **2.0+** | Major revisions with significant changes |

## What has it produced?

The site contains essays, courses, guides, notes, and other outputs - all produced through emergent scholarship practices. The content itself is valuable (work on AI in education, digital pedagogy, professional development), but so is its existence as a demonstration of the framework.

Browse the [live site](https://emergent-scholarship.org) to explore outputs organised by what you're trying to learn or do, not by content type.

## How can I engage?

This project uses GitHub as its collaborative platform, aligning with principles of openness, distributed participation, and networked knowledge creation.

**Ways to engage:**

1. **Read and use** - Apply the ideas and methods in your own practice
2. **Share and discuss** - Raise awareness about alternative approaches to knowledge work
3. **Open peer review** - [Create an issue](https://github.com/michael-rowe/sharing/issues) to offer feedback or suggest improvements
4. **Direct collaboration** - Request an invitation to become a co-creator

## Licence

This work is shared openly in the spirit of emergent scholarship principles. Content evolves transparently while maintaining academically citable versions through OSF preprints.
