> A framework for getting better at getting better

This is not a portfolio or collection of outputs. It's a **project** demonstrating a framework for the entire knowledge creation pipeline — from identifying problems worth solving, to learning systematically, to sharing what you've learned in ways that matter.

Think of it like an open source software project:
- **A working framework** you can learn from and adapt
- **A demonstration** of that framework in practice
- **A place where outputs accumulate** through the process
- **An invitation to participate** in a different way of working

## What is this project?

The site is primarily for **health professions educators** and others involved in developing practitioners — medical educators, clinical supervisors, curriculum designers, faculty developers. The content is grounded in health professions education theory and draws on examples from medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, and allied health.

It's built on a simple premise: most approaches to academic work focus on outputs (papers published, credentials earned, metrics achieved). The real leverage is in the process — how you identify what's worth learning, how you actually learn it, how you connect it to what you already know, how you share it in ways that create value.

The work here spans the full pipeline: essays, courses, notes, presentations, and a newsletter — all produced openly, with visible process, across a spectrum from early thinking to peer-reviewed publication.

## How does it work?

```
Obsidian (Markdown) → Git/GitHub → Quartz → GitHub Pages
                                      ↓
                             OSF (DOI + Preprint)
```

1. **Markdown** for writing — plain text focusing on content over presentation
2. **Git/GitHub** for versioning — transparent history and public engagement
3. **Quartz** for presentation — automated conversion to a responsive static site
4. **GitHub Actions** for deployment — automated building and publishing
5. **OSF** for academic citations — DOIs and permanent snapshots via preprints

### Essay versioning

Essays follow a semantic versioning system reflecting their maturity:

| Version | Stage |
|---------|-------|
| **0.5** | First shareable draft — coherent expression of the idea |
| **0.7** | Polished version — 1–2 rounds of edits |
| **0.9** | Final draft — published as preprint with DOI |
| **1.0** | Version of record — peer-reviewed publication |
| **1.1+** | Minor updates and clarifications |
| **2.0+** | Major revisions with significant changes |

## What has it produced?

The site contains essays, courses, guides, notes, and other outputs produced through this framework. The content is valuable in itself (work on AI in health professions education, digital pedagogy, professional development), but its existence also demonstrates the framework in practice — knowledge work done openly, with visible process.

Browse the [live site](https://michael-rowe.github.io/home-michael/) to explore outputs organised by what you're trying to learn or do.

## How can I engage?

This project uses GitHub as its collaborative platform.

**Ways to engage:**

1. **Read and use** — Apply the ideas and methods in your own practice
2. **Share and discuss** — Raise awareness about alternative approaches to knowledge work
3. **Open peer review** — [Create an issue](https://github.com/michael-rowe/home-michael/issues) to offer feedback or suggest improvements
4. **Direct collaboration** — Get in touch to discuss co-creation
